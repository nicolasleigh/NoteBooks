## Your First Command-Line Program in Go

```go
// main.go

package main

import (
	"bufio"
	"flag"
	"fmt"
	"io"
	"os"
)

func main() {

	// Defining a boolean flag -l to count iines instead of words
	lines := flag.Bool("l", false, "Count lines")

	// Parsing the flags provided by the user
	flag.Parse()

	// Calling the count function to count the number of words
	// received from the Standard Input and printing it out

	// Calling the count function to count the number of words (or lines)
	// received from the Standard Input and printing it out
	fmt.Println(count(os.Stdin, *lines))
}

func count(r io.Reader, countLines bool) int {
	// A scanner is used to read text from a Reader (such as files)
	scanner := bufio.NewScanner(r)

	// Define the scanner split type to words (default is split by lines)
	if !countLines {
		scanner.Split(bufio.ScanWords)
	}

	// Defining a counter
	wc := 0

	// For every word scanned, increment the counter
	for scanner.Scan() {
		wc++
	}

	// Return the total
	return wc
}


/*
cat main.go | ./wc                     
156       

cat main.go | ./wc -l       
46
*/
```

```go
// main_test.go

package main

import (
	"bytes"
	"testing"
)

// TestCountWords tests the count function set to count words
func TestCountWords(t *testing.T) {
	b := bytes.NewBufferString("word1 word2 word3 word4\n")
	exp := 4
	res := count(b, false)
	if res != exp {
		t.Errorf("Expected %d, got %d instead.\n", exp, res)
	}
}

// TestCountLines tests the count function set to count lines
func TestCountLines(t *testing.T) {
	b := bytes.NewBufferString("word1 word2 word3\nline2\nline3 word1")
	exp := 3
	res := count(b, true)
	if res != exp {
		t.Errorf("Expected %d, got %d instead.\n", exp, res)
	}
}

```

### Compiling Your Tool for Different Platforms

By default, the `go build` tool builds an executable binary for the current operating system and architecture. You can also use `go build` to build your commandline tool for a different platform even if you don’t have access to that platform.

For example, if you’re using Linux, you can build a Windows or macOS binary that can be executed on those platforms without Go installed. This process is called cross-compilation. Let’s build the word counter tool for the Windows platform by setting the `GOOS` environment variable to `windows` before running the build tool:

```
$ GOOS=windows go build
```

```
$ file wc.exe 
wc.exe: PE32+ executable (console) Aarch64, for MS Windows
```
