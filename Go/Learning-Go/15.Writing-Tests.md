### Understanding the Basics of Testing

Unlike many other languages, Go places its tests in the same directory and the same package as the production code. Since tests are located in the same package, they are able to access and test unexported functions and variables.

```go
func addNumbers(x, y int) int {
	return x + x
}
```

```go
func Test_addNumbers(t *testing.T) {
	result := addNumbers(2, 3)
	if result != 5 {
		t.Error("incorrect result: expected 5, got", result)
	}
}

```

Every test is written in a file whose name ends with _test.go. If you are writing tests against foo.go, place your tests in a file named foo_test.go.

Test functions start with the word Test and take in a single parameter of type *testing.T. By convention, this parameter is named t. Test functions do not return any values. The name of the test (apart from starting with the word “Test”) is meant to document what you are testing, so pick something that explains what you are testing. When writing unit tests for individual functions, the convention is to name the unit test Test followed by the name of the function. When testing unexported functions, some people use an underscore between the word Test and the name of the function.

The go test command allows you to specify which packages to test. Using ./... for the package name specifies that you want to run tests in the current directory and all subdirectories of the current directory. Include a -v flag to get verbose testing output.

#### Reporting Test Failures

While Error and Errorf mark a test as failed, the test function continues running. If you think a test function should stop processing as soon as a failure is found, use the Fatal and Fatalf methods. Note that this doesn’t exit all tests; any remaining test functions will execute after the current test function exits.

When should you use Fatal/Fatalf and when should you use Error/Errorf? If the failure of a check in a test means that further checks in the same test function will always fail or cause the test to panic, use Fatal or Fatalf. If you are testing several independent items (such as validating fields in a struct), then use Error or Errorf so you can report many problems at once. This makes it easier to fix multiple problems without rerunning your tests over and over.

#### Setting Up and Tearing Down

```go
var testTime time.Time 

func TestMain(m *testing.M) { 
  fmt.Println("Set up stuff for tests here")  
  testTime = time.Now()    
  exitVal := m.Run()  
  fmt.Println("Clean up stuff after tests here")   
  os.Exit(exitVal) 
}

func TestFirst(t *testing.T) {   
  fmt.Println("TestFirst uses stuff set up in TestMain", testTime)
}

func TestSecond(t *testing.T) {   
  fmt.Println("TestSecond also uses stuff set up in TestMain", testTime) 
}
```

Both TestFirst and TestSecond refer to the package-level variable testTime. Assume that it needs to be initialized in order for the tests to run properly. You declare a function called TestMain with a parameter of type *testing.M. If there’s a function named TestMain in a package, go test calls it instead of the test functions. It is the responsibility of the TestMain function to set up any state that’s necessary to make the tests in the package run correctly.

Once the state is configured, the TestMain function calls the Run method on *test ing.M. This runs the test functions in the package. The Run method returns the exit code; 0 indicates that all tests passed. Finally, the TestMain function must call os.Exit with the exit code returned from Run.

TestMain is useful in two common situations: 

- When you need to set up data in an external repository, such as a database 
- When the code being tested depends on package-level variables that need to be initialized 

As mentioned before (and will be again!), you should avoid package-level variables in your programs. They make it hard to understand how data flows through your program. If you are using TestMain for this reason, consider refactoring your code.

The Cleanup method on *testing.T is used to clean up temporary resources created for a single test. This method has a single parameter, a function with no input param‐eters or return values. The function runs when the test completes. For simple tests, you can achieve the same result by using a defer statement, but Cleanup is useful when tests rely on helper functions to set up sample data, as you see in Example 15-1. It’s fine to call Cleanup multiple times. Just like defer, the functions are invoked in last-added, first-called order.

```go
// Example 15-1. Using t.Cleanup 
// createFile is a helper function called from multiple tests 
func createFile(t *testing.T) (_ string, err error) {  
  f, err := os.Create("tempFile")   
  if err != nil {   
    return "", err  
  }    
  defer func() {       
    err = errors.Join(err, f.Close())   
  }()    
  // write some data to f    
  t.Cleanup(func() {    
    os.Remove(f.Name())   
  })   
  return f.Name(), nil
} 

func TestFileProcessing(t *testing.T) {  
  fName, err := createFile(t)  
  if err != nil {     
    t.Fatal(err)    
  }    
  // do testing, don't worry about cleanup
}
```

If your test uses temporary files, you can avoid writing cleanup code by taking advan‐tage of the TempDir method on *testing.T. This method creates a new temporary directory every time it is invoked and returns the full path of the directory. It also registers a handler with Cleanup to delete the directory and its contents when the test has completed. You can use it to rewrite the previous example:

```go
// createFile is a helper function called from multiple tests 
func createFile(tempDir string) (_ string, err error) {  
  f, err := os.CreateTemp(tempDir, "tempFile")  
  if err != nil {   
    return "", err   
  }  
  defer func() {  
    err = errors.Join(err, f.Close())  
  }()   
  // write some data to f   
  return f.Name(), nil 
}

func TestFileProcessing(t *testing.T) {   
  tempDir := t.TempDir()  
  fName, err := createFile(tempDir)  
  if err != nil {     
    t.Fatal(err)  
  }    
  // do testing, don't worry about cleanup 
}
```

#### Testing with Environment Variables

To help you test your environment-variable–parsing code, Go provides a helper method on testing.T. Call t.Setenv() to register a value for an environment variable for your test. Behind the scenes, it calls Cleanup to revert the environment variable to its previous state when the test exits:

```go
// assume ProcessEnvVars is a function that processes environment variables 
// and returns a struct with an OutputFormat field 
func TestEnvVarProcess(t *testing.T) {   
  t.Setenv("OUTPUT_FORMAT", "JSON")  
  cfg := ProcessEnvVars()   
  if cfg.OutputFormat != "JSON" {   
    t.Error("OutputFormat not set correctly")  
  }  
  // value of OUTPUT_FORMAT is reset when the test function exits 
}
```

Rather than writing this code yourself, you should strongly consider using a third-party configuration library, like [Viper](https://github.com/spf13/viper) or [envconfig](https://github.com/kelseyhightower/envconfig). Also, look at [GoDotEnv](https://github.com/joho/godotenv) as a way to store environment variables in .env files for development or continuous integration machines.

#### Storing Sample Test Data

As go test walks your source code tree, it uses the current package directory as the current working directory. If you want to use sample data to test functions in a package, create a subdirectory named testdata to hold your files.

#### Caching Test Results

Go also caches test results when running tests across multiple packages if they have passed and their code hasn’t changed. The tests are recompiled and rerun if you change any file in the package or in the testdata directory. You can also force tests to always run if you pass the flag -count=1 to go test.

#### Testing Your Public API

The tests that you’ve written are in the same package as the production code. This allows you to test both exported and unexported functions.

If you want to test just the public API of your package, Go has a convention for specifying this. You still keep your test source code in the same directory as the production source code, but you use packagename_test for the package name.

```go
func AddNumbers(x, y int) int {  
  return x + y 
}
```

```go
package pubadder_test 

import (  
  "github.com/learning-go-book-2e/ch15/sample_code/pubadder"   
  "testing" 
) 

func TestAddNumbers(t *testing.T) {  
  result := pubadder.AddNumbers(2, 3)   
  if result != 5 {       
    t.Error("incorrect result: expected 5, got", result)    
  }
}
```

#### Using go-cmp to Compare Test Results

Writing a thorough comparison of a compound type’s two instances can be verbose. While you can use reflect.DeepEqual to compare structs, maps, and slices, there’s a better way. Google released a third-party module called [go-cmp](https://github.com/google/go-cmp) that does the comparison for you and returns a detailed description of what does not match.

```go
type Person struct {
	Name      string
	Age       int
	DateAdded time.Time
}

func CreatePerson(name string, age int) Person {
	return Person{
		Name:      name,
		Age:       age,
		DateAdded: time.Now(),
	}
}
```

```go
package cmp

import (
	"testing"

	"github.com/google/go-cmp/cmp"
)

func TestCreatePerson(t *testing.T) {
	expected := Person{
		Name: "Dennis",
		Age:  37,
	}
	result := CreatePerson("Dennis", 37)
	if diff := cmp.Diff(expected, result); diff != "" {
		t.Error(diff)
	}
}

func TestCreatePersonIgnoreDate(t *testing.T) {
	expected := Person{
		Name: "Dennis",
		Age:  37,
	}
	result := CreatePerson("Dennis", 37)
	comparer := cmp.Comparer(func(x, y Person) bool {
		return x.Name == y.Name && x.Age == y.Age
	})
	if diff := cmp.Diff(expected, result, comparer); diff != "" {
		t.Error(diff)
	}
	if result.DateAdded.IsZero() {
		t.Error("DateAdded wasn't assigned")
	}
}
```

### Running Table Tests

```go
func DoMath(num1, num2 int, op string) (int, error) {
	switch op {
	case "+":
		return num1 + num2, nil
	case "-":
		return num1 - num2, nil
	case "*":
		return num1 + num2, nil
	case "/":
		if num2 == 0 {
			return 0, errors.New("division by zero")
		}
		return num1 / num2, nil
	default:
		return 0, fmt.Errorf("unknown operator %s", op)
	}
}
```

```go
func TestDoMath(t *testing.T) {
	result, err := DoMath(2, 2, "+")
	if result != 4 {
		t.Error("Should have been 4, got", result)
	}
	if err != nil {
		t.Error("Should have been nil error, got", err)
	}
	result2, err2 := DoMath(2, 2, "-")
	if result2 != 0 {
		t.Error("Should have been 0, got", result2)
	}
	if err2 != nil {
		t.Error("Should have been nil error, got", err2)
	}
	result3, err3 := DoMath(2, 2, "*")
	if result3 != 4 {
		t.Error("Should have been 4, got", result3)
	}
	if err3 != nil {
		t.Error("Should have been nil error, got", err3)
	}
	result4, err4 := DoMath(2, 2, "/")
	if result4 != 1 {
		t.Error("Should have been 1, got", result4)
	}
	if err4 != nil {
		t.Error("Should have been nil error, got", err4)
	}
}
```

Let’s replace this repetition with a table test. First, you declare a slice of anonymous structs. The struct contains fields for the name of the test, the input parameters, and the return values. Each entry in the slice represents another test:

```go
func TestDoMathTable(t *testing.T) {
	data := []struct {
		name     string
		num1     int
		num2     int
		op       string
		expected int
		errMsg   string
	}{
		{"addition", 2, 2, "+", 4, ""},
		{"subtraction", 2, 2, "-", 0, ""},
		{"multiplication", 2, 2, "*", 4, ""},
		{"division", 2, 2, "/", 1, ""},
		{"bad_division", 2, 0, "/", 0, `division by zero`},
	}
	for _, d := range data {
		t.Run(d.name, func(t *testing.T) {
			result, err := DoMath(d.num1, d.num2, d.op)
			if result != d.expected {
				t.Errorf("Expected %d, got %d", d.expected, result)
			}
			var errMsg string
			if err != nil {
				errMsg = err.Error()
			}
			if errMsg != d.errMsg {
				t.Errorf("Expected error message `%s`, got `%s`",
					d.errMsg, errMsg)
			}
		})
	}
}
```

### Running Tests Concurrently

By default, unit tests are run sequentially. Since each unit test is supposed to be independent from every other unit test, they make ideal candidates for concurrency. To make a unit test run concurrently with other tests, call the Parallel method on *testing.T as the first line in your test:

```go
func TestMyCode(t *testing.T) {  
  t.Parallel() 
  // rest of test goes here 
}
```

The advantage of parallel tests is that it can speed up long-running test suites. There are some disadvantages, though. If you have multiple tests that rely on the same shared mutable state, do not mark them as parallel, because you will get inconsistent results. Also be aware that your test will panic if you mark it as parallel and use the Setenv method in your test function.

Be careful when running table tests in parallel. When table tests run in parallel, it’s just as you saw in “Goroutines, for Loops, and Varying Variables” on page 298, where you launched multiple goroutines within a for loop. If you run this example using Go 1.21 or earlier (or on Go 1.22 or later with the Go version set to 1.21 or earlier in the go directive in the go.mod file), a reference to the variable d is shared by all the parallel tests, so they all see the same value:

```go
func TestParallelTable(t *testing.T) {
	data := []struct {
		name   string
		input  int
		output int
	}{
		{"a", 10, 20},
		{"b", 30, 40},
		{"c", 50, 60},
	}
	for _, d := range data {
		// d := d //UNCOMMENT THIS LINE SO THAT d IS SHADOWED AND THE TEST WORKS!
		t.Run(d.name, func(t *testing.T) {
			t.Parallel()
			fmt.Println(d.input, d.output)
			out := toTest(d.input)
			if out != d.output {
				t.Error("didn't match", out, d.output)
			}
		})
	}
}

/*

PASS
ok      github.com/learning-go-book-2e/ch15/sample_code/parallel        0.923s
*/
```

### Checking Your Code Coverage

Adding the -cover flag to the go test command calculates coverage informa‐tion and includes a summary in the test output. If you include a second flag -coverprofile, you can save the coverage information to a file.

```sh
$ go test -v -cover -coverprofile=c.out
```

It’d be more useful if you could see what you missed. The cover tool included with Go generates an HTML representation of your source code with that information:

```sh
$ go tool cover -html=c.out
```
