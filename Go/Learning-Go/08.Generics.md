Let’s see how to make a stack using generics:

```go
type Stack[T any] struct { 
  vals []T 
} 

func (s *Stack[T]) Push(val T) {  
  s.vals = append(s.vals, val)
} 

func (s *Stack[T]) Pop() (T, bool) { 
  if len(s.vals) == 0 {
    var zero T     
    return zero, false 
  }   
  top := s.vals[len(s.vals)-1]   
  s.vals = s.vals[:len(s.vals)-1]
  return top, true
}
```

Note that you refer to the type in the receiver section with `Stack[T]` instead of `Stack`. Generics make zero value handling a little interesting. In `Pop`, you can’t just return `nil`, because that’s not a valid value for a value type, like `int`. The easiest way to get a zero value for a generic is to simply declare a variable with `var` and return it, since by definition, `var` always initializes its variable to the zero value if no other value is assigned.

Using a generic type is similar to using a nongeneric one:

```go
func main() { 
  var intStack Stack[int]  
  intStack.Push(10)  
  intStack.Push(20)  
  intStack.Push(30)  
  v, ok := intStack.Pop()   
  fmt.Println(v, ok)    // 30 true
}
```

Add another method to your stack to tell you if the stack contains a value:

```go
func (s Stack[T]) Contains(val T) bool {  
  for _, v := range s.vals {  
    if v == val {   
      return true  
    }   
  }  
  return false 
}
```

Unfortunately, this does not compile. It gives an error: `invalid operation: v == val (incomparable types in type set)`

Just as `interface{}` doesn’t say anything, neither does `any`. You can only store values of any type and retrieve them. To use ==, you need a different type. Since nearly all Go types can be compared with == and !=, a new built-in interface called `comparable` is defined in the universe block. If you change the definition of `Stack` to use `comparable`:

```go
type Stack[T comparable] struct {  
  vals []T
}
```

you can then use your new method:

```go
func main() {  
  var s Stack[int] 
  s.Push(10) 
  s.Push(20)   
  s.Push(30)   
  fmt.Println(s.Contains(10))  // true
  fmt.Println(s.Contains(5))   // false
}
```

##### Map, Reduce, and Filter

```go
// Map turns a []T1 to a []T2 using a mapping function.
// This function has two type parameters, T1 and T2.
// This works with slices of any type.
func Map[T1, T2 any](s []T1, f func(T1) T2) []T2 {
	r := make([]T2, len(s))
	for i, v := range s {
		r[i] = f(v)
	}
	return r
}
```

```go
// Reduce reduces a []T1 to a single value using a reduction function.
func Reduce[T1, T2 any](s []T1, initializer T2, f func(T2, T1) T2) T2 {
	r := initializer
	for _, v := range s {
		r = f(r, v)
	}
	return r
}
```

```go
// Filter filters values from a slice using a filter function.
// It returns a new slice with only the elements of s
// for which f returned true.
func Filter[T any](s []T, f func(T) bool) []T {
	var r []T
	for _, v := range s {
		if f(v) {
			r = append(r, v)
		}
	}
	return r
}
```

##### Use Type Terms to Specify Operators

The `divAndRemainder` function works fine with `int`, but using it with other integer types requires type casting. Go generics do that with a **type element**, which is composed of one or more **type terms** within an interface

```go
type Integer interface {  
  int | int8 | int16 | int32 | int64 |  
  uint | uint8 | uint16 | uint32 | uint64 | uintptr 
}
```

**Type elements** specify which types can be assigned to a **type parameter** and which operators are supported. They list concrete types separated by `|`. The allowed operators are the ones that are valid for all of the listed types. The modulus (`%`) operator is valid only for integers, so we list all integer types.

```go
func divAndRemainder[T Integer](num, denom T) (T, T, error) {  
  if denom == 0 {   
    return 0, 0, errors.New("cannot divide by zero") 
  }     
  return num / denom, num % denom, nil 
}

func main() {  
  var a uint = 18_446_744_073_709_551_615   
  var b uint = 9_223_372_036_854_775_808   
  fmt.Println(divAndRemainder(a, b))   // 1 9223372036854775807 <nil>
}
```

By default, **type terms** match exactly. If you try to use `divAndRemainder` with a user-defined type whose underlying type is one of the types listed in Integer, you’ll get an error. This code produces the following error: ` MyInt does not satisfy Integer (possibly missing ~ for int in Integer)`

```go
type MyInt int 
var myA MyInt = 10 
var myB MyInt = 20 
fmt.Println(divAndRemainder(myA, myB))  // error
```

The error text gives a hint for how to solve this problem. If you want a type term to be valid for any type that has the **type term** as its underlying type, put a `~` before the **type term**. This changes the definition of Integer as follows:

```go
type Integer interface {  
  ~int | ~int8 | ~int16 | ~int32 | ~int64 |   
  ~uint | ~uint8 | ~uint16 | ~uint32 | ~uint64 | ~uintptr
}
```

The addition of type terms allows you to define a type that lets you write generic comparison functions:

```go
type Ordered interface {   
  ~int | ~int8 | ~int16 | ~int32 | ~int64 |  
  ~uint | ~uint8 | ~uint16 | ~uint32 | ~uint64 | ~uintptr |    
  ~float32 | ~float64 | ~string 
}
```

The `Ordered` interface lists all types that support the `==, !=, <, >, <=, and >=` operators. Having a way to specify that a variable represents an orderable type is so useful that Go 1.21 added the `cmp` package, which defines this `Ordered` interface. The package also defines two comparison functions. The `Compare` function returns either –1, 0, or 1, depending on whether its first parameter is less than, equal to, or greater than its second parameter, and the `Less` function returns true if its first parameter is less than its second parameter.

It is legal to have both **type elements** and **method elements** in an interface used for a **type parameter**. For example, you could specify that a type must have an underlying type of `int` and a `String()` string method:

```go
type PrintableInt interface {   
  ~int  
  String() string
}
```

Be aware that Go will let you declare a **type parameter interface** that is impossible to actually instantiate. If you had used `int` instead of `~int` in `PrintableInt`, there would be no valid type that meets it, since `int` has no methods. This might seem bad, but the compiler still comes to your rescue. Assume you declare these types:

```go
type ImpossiblePrintableInt interface {   
  int  
  String() string 
} 

type ImpossibleStruct[T ImpossiblePrintableInt] struct {   
  val T 
} 

type MyInt int 

func (mi MyInt) String() string { 
  return fmt.Sprint(mi)
}
```

Even though you cannot instantiate `ImpossibleStruct`, the compiler has no problem with any of these declarations. However, once you try using `ImpossibleStruct`, the compiler complains. This code will cause compile-time errors:

```go
s := ImpossibleStruct[int]{10}  // int does not satisfy ImpossiblePrintableInt (missing method String)
s2 := ImpossibleStruct[MyInt]{10}  // MyInt does not satisfy ImpossiblePrintableInt (possibly missing ~ for int in ImpossiblePrintableInt)
```

##### Type Elements Limit Constants

**Type elements** also specify which **constants** can be assigned to variables of the generic type. Like operators, the **constants** need to be valid for **all the type terms** in the type element. If you use the `Integer` interface, the following code will not compile, because you cannot assign the value 1,000 to an 8-bit integer:

```go
type Integer interface {  
  ~int | ~int8 | ~int16 | ~int32 | ~int64 |   
  ~uint | ~uint8 | ~uint16 | ~uint32 | ~uint64 | ~uintptr
}

// INVALID! 
func PlusOneThousand[T Integer](in T) T {  
  return in + 1000  // error: cannot convert 1000 (untyped int constant) to type T
} 

// VALID 
func PlusOneHundred[T Integer](in T) T {
  return in + 100 
}
```
