## Metrics

When your application is running in production, you might want to answer questions like:

- How much memory is my application using? 
- How is this changing over time? How many goroutines are currently in use? 
- How is this changing over time? How many database connections are in use and how many are idle? Do I need to change the connection pool settings? 
- What is the ratio of successful HTTP responses to both client and server errors? Are error rates elevated above normal?

Having insight into these things can help inform your hardware and configuration setting choices, and act as an early warning sign of potential problems (such as memory leaks). 

To assist with this, Go’s standard library includes the `expvar` package which makes it easy to collate and view different application metrics at runtime.

### Exposing Metrics with Expvar

Viewing metrics for our application is made easy by the fact that the `expvar` package provides an `expvar.Handler()` function which returns a HTTP handler exposing your application metrics. 

By default this handler displays information about memory usage, along with a reminder of what command-line flags you used when starting the application, all outputted in JSON format.

```go
// File: cmd/api/routes.go 

package main 

import (  
  "expvar" // New import   
  "net/http"  
  
  "github.com/julienschmidt/httprouter" 
)

func (app *application) routes() http.Handler {  
  router := httprouter.New()  
  
  router.NotFound = http.HandlerFunc(app.notFoundResponse)
  router.MethodNotAllowed = http.HandlerFunc(app.methodNotAllowedResponse)   
  
  router.HandlerFunc(http.MethodGet, "/v1/healthcheck", app.healthcheckHandler) 
  
  router.HandlerFunc(http.MethodGet, "/v1/movies", app.requirePermission("movies:read", app.listMoviesHandler))    
  router.HandlerFunc(http.MethodPost, "/v1/movies", app.requirePermission("movies:write", app.createMovieHandler))  
  router.HandlerFunc(http.MethodGet, "/v1/movies/:id", app.requirePermission("movies:read", app.showMovieHandler))   
  router.HandlerFunc(http.MethodPatch, "/v1/movies/:id", app.requirePermission("movies:write", app.updateMovieHandler))  
  router.HandlerFunc(http.MethodDelete, "/v1/movies/:id", app.requirePermission("movies:write", app.deleteMovieHandler))  
  
  router.HandlerFunc(http.MethodPost, "/v1/users", app.registerUserHandler)    
  router.HandlerFunc(http.MethodPut, "/v1/users/activated", app.activateUserHandler) 
  
  router.HandlerFunc(http.MethodPost, "/v1/tokens/authentication", app.createAuthenticationTokenHandler)    
  
  // Register a new GET /debug/vars endpoint pointing to the expvar handler.
  router.Handler(http.MethodGet, "/debug/vars", expvar.Handler())  
  
  return app.recoverPanic(app.enableCORS(app.rateLimit(app.authenticate(router))))
}
```

Now, start the server:

```
$ go run ./cmd/api -limiter-enabled=false -port=4000
```

and visit `http://localhost:4000/debug/vars`

We can see that the JSON here currently contains two top-level items: "`cmdline`" and "`memstats`".

The "memstats" item contains a ‘moment-in-time’ snapshot of memory usage, as returned by the [runtime.MemStats()](https://pkg.go.dev/runtime#MemStats) function. The most important ones are:

- `TotalAlloc` — Cumulative bytes allocated on the heap (will not decrease). 
- `HeapAlloc` — Current number of bytes on the heap. 
- `HeapObjects` — Current number of objects on the heap. 
- `Sys` — Total bytes of memory obtained from the OS (i.e. total memory reserved by the Go runtime for the heap, stacks, and other internal data structures). 
- `NumGC` — Number of completed garbage collector cycles. 
- `NextGC` — The target heap size of the next garbage collector cycle (Go aims to keep `HeapAlloc` ≤ `NextGC`).

### Creating Custom Metrics

```go
// File: cmd/api/main.go 

package main 

import (  
  "context"  
  "database/sql"  
  "expvar" // New import   
  "flag"   
  "log/slog"  
  "os"   
  "strings"  
  "sync"    
  "time"    
  
  "greenlight.alexedwards.net/internal/data"   
  "greenlight.alexedwards.net/internal/mailer"  
  
  _ "github.com/lib/pq" ) 

// Remember, our version number is just a constant string (for now).
const version = "1.0.0" 

...

func main() {   
  ...
  
  // Publish a new "version" variable in the expvar handler containing our application
  // version number (currently the constant "1.0.0").
  expvar.NewString("version").Set(version) 
  
  app := &application{      
    config: cfg,    
    logger: logger,   
    models: data.NewModels(db),
    mailer: mailer.New(cfg.smtp.host, cfg.smtp.port, cfg.smtp.username, cfg.smtp.password, cfg.smtp.sender),  
  }  
  
  err = app.serve()  
  if err != nil {     
    logger.Error(err.Error())  
    os.Exit(1)    
  } 
}

...
```

If you restart the API and visit `http://localhost:4000/debug/vars` in your web browser again, you should now see a `"version": "1.0.0"` item in the JSON.

#### Dynamic metrics

Occasionally you might want to publish metrics which require you to call other code — or do some kind of pre-processing — to generate the necessary information. To help with this there is the [expvar.Publish()](https://pkg.go.dev/expvar@go1.23.4#Publish) function, which allows you to publish the result of a function in the JSON output. 

For example, if you want to publish the number of currently active goroutines from Go’s [runtime.NumGoroutine()](https://pkg.go.dev/runtime#NumGoroutine) function, you could write the following code:

```go
expvar.Publish("goroutines", expvar.Func(func() any {  
  return runtime.NumGoroutine()
}))
```

It’s important to point out here that the any value returned from this function must encode to JSON without any errors. If it can’t be encoded to JSON, then it will be omitted from the `expvar` output and the response from the `GET /debug/vars` endpoint will be malformed. Any error will be silently discarded. 

In the case of the code snippet above, `runtime.NumGoroutine()` returns a regular int type —which will encode to a JSON number. So there’s no problem with that here.

```go
// File: cmd/api/main.go 

package main 

import (  
  "context"  
  "database/sql"  
  "expvar"  
  "flag"  
  "log/slog"  
  "os"    
  "runtime" // New import  
  "strings"   
  "sync"   
  "time"  
  
  "greenlight.alexedwards.net/internal/data"  
  "greenlight.alexedwards.net/internal/mailer"   
  
  _ "github.com/lib/pq" 
)

...

func main() {   
  
  ...
  
  expvar.NewString("version").Set(version)  
  
  // Publish the number of active goroutines.
  expvar.Publish("goroutines", expvar.Func(func() any {  
    return runtime.NumGoroutine()   
  }))    
  
  // Publish the database connection pool statistics.
  expvar.Publish("database", expvar.Func(func() any {     
    return db.Stats()    
  })) 
  
  // Publish the current Unix timestamp.
  expvar.Publish("timestamp", expvar.Func(func() any {    
    return time.Now().Unix()   
  }))   
  
  app := &application{  
    config: cfg,     
    logger: logger,     
    models: data.NewModels(db),    
    mailer: mailer.New(cfg.smtp.host, cfg.smtp.port, cfg.smtp.username, cfg.smtp.password, cfg.smtp.sender),   
  }   
  err = app.serve()  
  if err != nil {   
    logger.Error(err.Error())     
    os.Exit(1)   
  }
}

...
```

If you restart the API and open the `GET /debug/vars` endpoint in your browser again, you should now see the additional `"database"`, `"goroutines"` and `"timestamp"` items in the JSON.

#### Additional Information

##### Protecting the metrics endpoint

It’s important to be aware that these metrics provide very useful information to anyone who wants to perform a denial-of-service attack against your application, and that the `"cmdline"` values may also expose potentially sensitive information (like a database DSN). 

So you should make sure to restrict access to the `GET /debug/vars` endpoint when running in a production environment. 

There are a few different approaches you could take to do this. 

One option is to leverage our existing authentication process and create a `metrics:view` permission so that only certain trusted users can access the endpoint. Another option would be to use HTTP Basic Authentication to restrict access to the endpoint. 

In our case, when we deploy our application in production later we will run it behind [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/) as a reverse proxy. As part of our Caddy set up, we’ll restrict access to the `GET /debug/vars` endpoint so that it can only be accessed via connections from the local machine, rather than being exposed on the internet.

### Request-level Metrics

```go
// File: cmd/api/middleware.go 

package main 

import (  
  "errors"  
  "expvar" // New import   
  "fmt"  
  "net"    
  "net/http"  
  "strings"   
  "sync"  
  "time"   
  
  "greenlight.alexedwards.net/internal/data"   
  "greenlight.alexedwards.net/internal/validator"  
  
  "golang.org/x/time/rate" 
)

...

func (app *application) metrics(next http.Handler) http.Handler {  
  // Initialize the new expvar variables when the middleware chain is first built.
  var (      
    totalRequestsReceived           = expvar.NewInt("total_requests_received") 
    totalResponsesSent              = expvar.NewInt("total_responses_sent")    
    totalProcessingTimeMicroseconds = expvar.NewInt("total_processing_time_μs") 
  )     
  
  // The following code will be run for every request...
  return http.HandlerFunc(func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {     
    // Record the time that we started to process the request.
    start := time.Now()    
    
    // Use the Add() method to increment the number of requests received by 1.
    totalRequestsReceived.Add(1)  
    
    // Call the next handler in the chain.
    next.ServeHTTP(w, r)   
    
    // On the way back up the middleware chain, increment the number of responses   
    // sent by 1.
    totalResponsesSent.Add(1)     
    
    // Calculate the number of microseconds since we began to process the request, 
    // then increment the total processing time by this amount.
    duration := time.Since(start).Microseconds()   
    totalProcessingTimeMicroseconds.Add(duration)  
  })
}
```

```go
// File: cmd/api/routes.go 

package main 

...

func (app *application) routes() http.Handler { 
  router := httprouter.New()
  
  router.NotFound = http.HandlerFunc(app.notFoundResponse)   
  router.MethodNotAllowed = http.HandlerFunc(app.methodNotAllowedResponse)   
  
  router.HandlerFunc(http.MethodGet, "/v1/healthcheck", app.healthcheckHandler)  
  
  router.HandlerFunc(http.MethodGet, "/v1/movies", app.requirePermission("movies:read", app.listMoviesHandler))    
  router.HandlerFunc(http.MethodPost, "/v1/movies", app.requirePermission("movies:write", app.createMovieHandler)) 
  router.HandlerFunc(http.MethodGet, "/v1/movies/:id", app.requirePermission("movies:read", app.showMovieHandler)) 
  router.HandlerFunc(http.MethodPatch, "/v1/movies/:id", app.requirePermission("movies:write", app.updateMovieHandler)) 
  router.HandlerFunc(http.MethodDelete, "/v1/movies/:id", app.requirePermission("movies:write", app.deleteMovieHandler)) 
  
  router.HandlerFunc(http.MethodPost, "/v1/users", app.registerUserHandler)  
  router.HandlerFunc(http.MethodPut, "/v1/users/activated", app.activateUserHandler)  
  
  router.HandlerFunc(http.MethodPost, "/v1/tokens/authentication", app.createAuthenticationTokenHandler)  
  
  router.Handler(http.MethodGet, "/debug/vars", expvar.Handler())  
  
  // Use the new metrics() middleware at the start of the chain.
  return app.metrics(app.recoverPanic(app.enableCORS(app.rateLimit(app.authenticate(router)))))
}
```

#### Additional Information

##### Calculating additional metrics

The number of ‘active’ in-flight requests:

```
total_requests_received - total_responses_sent
```

The average number of requests received per second (between calls A and B to the `GET /debug/vars` endpoint):

```
(total_requests_received_B - total_requests_received_A) / (timestamp_B - timestamp_A)
```

The average processing time per request (between calls A and B to the `GET /debug/vars` endpoint):

```
(total_processing_time_μs_B - total_processing_time_μs_A) / (total_requests_received_B - total_requests_received_A)
```

### Recording HTTP Status Codes

As well as recording the total count of responses sent, we can take this further and extend our `metrics()` middleware to start tallying exactly which HTTP status codes our responses had. 

The tricky part of doing this is finding out what HTTP status code a response has in our `metrics()` middleware. Unfortunately Go doesn’t support this out-of-the-box — there is no built-in way to examine a `http.ResponseWriter` to see what status code is going to be sent to a client. 

To capture the response status code, we’ll instead need to create our own custom `http.ResponseWriter` that records a copy of the HTTP status code for future access. 

Before Go 1.20 was released, doing this was brittle and awkward to get right. But now Go has the new `http.ResponseController` type with support for `http.ResponseWriter` unwrapping, it’s suddenly become much more straightforward to implement yourself.	

**Hint**: If you need to work with an older version of Go, I highly recommend using the third-party [httpsnoop](https://github.com/felixge/httpsnoop/) package rather than implementing your own custom `http.ResponseWriter`.

The code we want to write looks like this:

```go
// The metricsResponseWriter type wraps an existing http.ResponseWriter and also 
// contains a field for recording the response status code, and a boolean flag to 
// indicate whether the response headers have already been written.
type metricsResponseWriter struct {  
  wrapped       http.ResponseWriter   
  statusCode    int    
  headerWritten bool 
}

// This function returns a new metricsResponseWriter instance which wraps a given 
// http.ResponseWriter and has a status code of 200 (which is the status 
// code that Go will send in a HTTP response by default).
func newMetricsResponseWriter(w http.ResponseWriter) *metricsResponseWriter {  
  return &metricsResponseWriter{  
    wrapped:    w,      
    statusCode: http.StatusOK,  
  }
}

// The Header() method is a simple 'pass through' to the Header() method of the 
// wrapped http.ResponseWriter.
func (mw *metricsResponseWriter) Header() http.Header {   
  return mw.wrapped.Header()
}

// Again, the WriteHeader() method does a 'pass through' to the WriteHeader() 
// method of the wrapped http.ResponseWriter. But after this returns, 
// we also record the response status code (if it hasn't already been recorded) 
// and set the headerWritten field to true to indicate that the HTTP response  
// headers have now been written.
func (mw *metricsResponseWriter) WriteHeader(statusCode int) { 
  mw.wrapped.WriteHeader(statusCode) 
  if !mw.headerWritten {       
    mw.statusCode = statusCode      
    mw.headerWritten = true  
  }
}

// Likewise the Write() method does a 'pass through' to the Write() method of the 
// wrapped http.ResponseWriter. Calling this will automatically write any 
// response headers, so we set the headerWritten field to true.
func (mw *metricsResponseWriter) Write(b []byte) (int, error) {  
  mw.headerWritten = true    
  return mw.wrapped.Write(b) 
}

// We also need an Unwrap() method which returns the existing wrapped 
// http.ResponseWriter.
func (mw *metricsResponseWriter) Unwrap() http.ResponseWriter { 
  return mw.wrapped 
}
```

The important thing to realize is that our `metricsResponseWriter` type satisfies the `http.ResponseWriter` interface. It has `Header()`, `WriteHeader()` and `Write()` methods with the appropriate signature, so we can use it in our handlers just like normal. 

Also, notice that we don’t record the status code until after the ‘pass through’ call in the `WriteHeader()` method. This is because a panic in that operation (potentially due to an invalid status code) may mean that a different status code is ultimately sent to the client.

Lastly, we also set a default status code of `200 OK` in the `newMetricsResponseWriter()` function. It’s important that we set this default here, in case a handler doesn’t ever call `Write()` or `WriteHeader()`. 

But ultimately, our `metricsResponseWriter` is really just a light layer over the top of an existing `http.ResponseWriter` value. 

Let’s move on, and adapt our `metrics()` middleware to use this. We’ll also need to publish a new `total_responses_sent_by_status` variable using the `expvar.NewMap()` function. This will give us a map in which we can store the different HTTP status codes, along with a running count of responses for each status.

```go
// File: cmd/api/middleware.go 

package main 

import (  
  "errors"   
  "expvar"    
  "fmt"   
  "net"  
  "net/http" 
  "strconv" // New import 
  "strings"  
  "sync"   
  "time"   
  
  "greenlight.alexedwards.net/internal/data"     
  "greenlight.alexedwards.net/internal/validator" 
  
  "golang.org/x/time/rate" 
)

...

type metricsResponseWriter struct {  
  wrapped       http.ResponseWriter   
  statusCode    int 
  headerWritten bool 
}

func newMetricsResponseWriter(w http.ResponseWriter) *metricsResponseWriter {  
  return &metricsResponseWriter{     
    wrapped:    w,   
    statusCode: http.StatusOK,   
  }
}

func (mw *metricsResponseWriter) Header() http.Header {  
  return mw.wrapped.Header() 
}

func (mw *metricsResponseWriter) WriteHeader(statusCode int) {   
  mw.wrapped.WriteHeader(statusCode)   
  if !mw.headerWritten {     
    mw.statusCode = statusCode  
    mw.headerWritten = true   
  }
}

func (mw *metricsResponseWriter) Write(b []byte) (int, error) {  
  mw.headerWritten = true  
  return mw.wrapped.Write(b) 
}

func (mw *metricsResponseWriter) Unwrap() http.ResponseWriter { 
  return mw.wrapped 
}

func (app *application) metrics(next http.Handler) http.Handler {  
  var (     
    totalRequestsReceived           = expvar.NewInt("total_requests_received")   
    totalResponsesSent              = expvar.NewInt("total_responses_sent")   
    totalProcessingTimeMicroseconds = expvar.NewInt("total_processing_time_μs")  
    
    // Declare a new expvar map to hold the count of responses for each HTTP status       // code.
    totalResponsesSentByStatus = expvar.NewMap("total_responses_sent_by_status")   
  )   
  
  return http.HandlerFunc(func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {  
    start := time.Now()    
    totalRequestsReceived.Add(1)    
    
    // Create a new metricsResponseWriter, which wraps the original   
    // http.ResponseWriter value that the metrics middleware received.
    mw := newMetricsResponseWriter(w)   
    
    // Call the next handler in the chain using the new metricsResponseWriter  
    // as the http.ResponseWriter value.
    next.ServeHTTP(mw, r)    
    
    totalResponsesSent.Add(1)   
    
    // At this point, the response status code should be stored in the   
    // mw.statusCode field. Note that the expvar map is string-keyed, so we   
    // need to use the strconv.Itoa() function to convert the status code    
    // (which is an integer) to a string. Then we use the Add() method on   
    // our new totalResponsesSentByStatus map to increment the count for the 
    // given status code by 1.
    totalResponsesSentByStatus.Add(strconv.Itoa(mw.statusCode), 1) 
    
    duration := time.Since(start).Microseconds()  
    totalProcessingTimeMicroseconds.Add(duration)   
  })
}
```

#### Additional Information

##### Visualizing and analyzing metrics

At the other end of the spectrum, you might want to use a tool like [Prometheus](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus) to fetch and visualize the data from the endpoint, and display graphs of the metrics in real-time.

##### Embedded http.ResponseWriter

If you want, you could change the `metricsResponseWriter` struct so that it embeds a `http.ResponseWriter` instead of wrapping it. Like this:

```go
type metricsResponseWriter struct { 
  http.ResponseWriter  
  statusCode    int  
  headerWritten bool 
}

func newMetricsResponseWriter(w http.ResponseWriter) *metricsResponseWriter {  
  return &metricsResponseWriter{      
    ResponseWriter: w,    
    statusCode:     http.StatusOK,   
  }
}

func (mw *metricsResponseWriter) WriteHeader(statusCode int) {  
  mw.ResponseWriter.WriteHeader(statusCode)    
  if !mw.headerWritten {    
    mw.statusCode = statusCode   
    mw.headerWritten = true  
  }
}

func (mw *metricsResponseWriter) Write(b []byte) (int, error) {  
  mw.headerWritten = true   
  return mw.ResponseWriter.Write(b)
}

func (mw *metricsResponseWriter) Unwrap() http.ResponseWriter {  
  return mw.ResponseWriter 
}
```

This will give you the same end result as the original approach. However, the gain is that you don’t need to write a `Header()` method for the `metricsResponseWriter` struct (it’s automatically promoted from the embedded `http.ResponseWriter`).
