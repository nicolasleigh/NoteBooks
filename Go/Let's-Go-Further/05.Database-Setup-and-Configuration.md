### Setting up PostgreSQL

#### Creating databases, users, and extensions

```sh
postgres=# CREATE DATABASE greenlight;

postgres=# \c greenlight

greenlight=# CREATE ROLE greenlight WITH LOGIN PASSWORD 'pa55word';

greenlight=# CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS citext;

greenlight=# exit

$ psql --host=localhost --dbname=greenlight --username=greenlight

greenlight=> SELECT current_user;
```

### Connecting to PostgreSQL

#### Establishing a connection pool

```go
// File: cmd/api/main.go 

package main 

import (   
  "context"      // New import   
  "database/sql" // New import   
  "flag"  
  "fmt"   
  "log/slog"  
  "net/http"  
  "os"   
  "time"   
  
  // Import the pq driver so that it can register itself with the database/sql  
  // package. Note that we alias this import to the blank identifier, to stop the Go  
  // compiler complaining that the package isn't being used.
  _ "github.com/lib/pq" 
)

const version = "1.0.0" 

// Add a db struct field to hold the configuration settings for our database connection 
// pool. For now this only holds the DSN, which we will read in from a command-line flag.
type config struct {  
  port int   
  env  string  
  db   struct {   
    dsn string  
  }
}

type application struct { 
  config config   
  logger *slog.Logger 
}

func main() {   
  var cfg config   
  
  flag.IntVar(&cfg.port, "port", 4000, "API server port")  
  flag.StringVar(&cfg.env, "env", "development", "Environment (development|staging|production)")  
  
  // Read the DSN value from the db-dsn command-line flag into the config struct. We  
  // default to using our development DSN if no flag is provided.
  flag.StringVar(&cfg.db.dsn, "db-dsn", "postgres://greenlight:pa55word@localhost/greenlight", "PostgreSQL DSN")   
  
  flag.Parse()   
  
  logger := slog.New(slog.NewTextHandler(os.Stdout, nil)) 
  
  // Call the openDB() helper function (see below) to create the connection pool, 
  // passing in the config struct. If this returns an error, we log it and exit the   
  // application immediately.
  db, err := openDB(cfg)    
  if err != nil {     
    logger.Error(err.Error())   
    os.Exit(1)   
  }    
  
  // Defer a call to db.Close() so that the connection pool is closed before the   
  // main() function exits.
  defer db.Close()   
  
  // Also log a message to say that the connection pool has been successfully 
  // established.
  logger.Info("database connection pool established")   
  
  app := &application{    
    config: cfg,   
    logger: logger, 
  }    
  
  srv := &http.Server{    
    Addr:         fmt.Sprintf(":%d", cfg.port),   
    Handler:      app.routes(),      
    IdleTimeout:  time.Minute,     
    ReadTimeout:  5 * time.Second,    
    WriteTimeout: 10 * time.Second,    
    ErrorLog:     slog.NewLogLogger(logger.Handler(), slog.LevelError),   
  }    
  
  logger.Info("starting server", "addr", srv.Addr, "env", cfg.env)   
  
  // Because the err variable is now already declared in the code above, we need  
  // to use the = operator here, instead of the := operator.
  err = srv.ListenAndServe()  
  logger.Error(err.Error())   
  os.Exit(1) 
}

// The openDB() function returns a sql.DB connection pool.
func openDB(cfg config) (*sql.DB, error) {   
  // Use sql.Open() to create an empty connection pool, using the DSN from the config 
  // struct.
  db, err := sql.Open("postgres", cfg.db.dsn) 
  if err != nil {   
    return nil, err   
  }   
  
  // Create a context with a 5-second timeout deadline.
  ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), 5*time.Second)   
  defer cancel()   
  
  // Use PingContext() to establish a new connection to the database, passing in the  
  // context we created above as a parameter. If the connection couldn't be  
  // established successfully within the 5 second deadline, then this will return an  
  // error. If we get this error, or any other, we close the connection pool and  
  // return the error.
  err = db.PingContext(ctx)   
  if err != nil {   
    db.Close()    
    return nil, err  
  }    
  
  // Return the sql.DB connection pool.
  return db, nil 
}
```

#### Decoupling the DSN

Create a new `GREENLIGHT_DB_DSN` environment variable by adding the following line to either your `$HOME/.profile` or `$HOME/.bashrc` or `$HOME/.zshrc` files:

```
File: $HOME/.zshrc 

...

export GREENLIGHT_DB_DSN='postgres://greenlight:pa55word@localhost/greenlight'
```

Once that’s done you’ll need to reboot your computer, or — if that’s not convenient right now — run the source command on the file that you’ve just edited to effect the change. For example:

```
$ source $HOME/.zshrc
```

Now you should be able to see the value for the `GREENLIGHT_DB_DSN` environment variable in your terminal by running the echo command. Like so:

```
$ echo $GREENLIGHT_DB_DSN
```

```go
// File: cmd/api/main.go 

package main 

...

func main() {  
  var cfg config  
  
  flag.IntVar(&cfg.port, "port", 4000, "API server port")  
  flag.StringVar(&cfg.env, "env", "development", "Environment (development|staging|production)")   
  
  // Use the value of the GREENLIGHT_DB_DSN environment variable as the default value  
  // for our db-dsn command-line flag.
  flag.StringVar(&cfg.db.dsn, "db-dsn", os.Getenv("GREENLIGHT_DB_DSN"), "PostgreSQL DSN")  
  
  flag.Parse()   
  
  ...
}
```

You can also try specifying the `-help` flag when running the application.

```
$ go run ./cmd/api -help 
Usage of /tmp/go-build417842398/b001/exe/api: 
	-db-dsn string    
  		PostgreSQL DSN (default "postgres://greenlight:pa55word@localhost/greenlight")  
  -env string      
  		Environment (development|staging|production) (default "development")   
 	-port int     
  		API server port (default 4000)
```

#### Additional Information

##### Using the DSN with psql

A nice side effect of storing the DSN in an environment variable is that you can use it to easily connect to the greenlight database as the greenlight user, rather than specifying all the connection options manually when running psql. Like so:

```
$ psql $GREENLIGHT_DB_DSN
```

### Configuring the Database Connection Pool

So how does the sql.DB connection pool work? 

The most important thing to understand is that a sql.DB pool contains two types of connections — ‘in-use’ connections and ‘idle’ connections. A connection is marked as in-use when you are using it to perform a database task, such as executing a SQL statement or querying rows, and when the task is complete the connection is then marked as idle.

When you instruct Go to perform a database task, it will first check if any idle connections are available in the pool. If one is available, then Go will reuse this existing connection and mark it as in-use for the duration of the task. If there are no idle connections in the pool when you need one, then Go will create a new additional connection.

When Go reuses an idle connection from the pool, any problems with the connection are handled gracefully. Bad connections will automatically be re-tried twice before giving up, at which point Go will remove the bad connection from the pool and create a new one to carry out the task.

#### Configuring the pool

##### The SetMaxOpenConns method

The [SetMaxOpenConns()](https://pkg.go.dev/database/sql#DB.SetMaxOpenConns) method allows you to set an upper MaxOpenConns limit on the number of ‘open’ connections (in-use + idle connections) in the pool. By default, the number of open connections is unlimited.

Broadly speaking, the higher that you set the MaxOpenConns limit, the more database queries can be performed concurrently and the lower the risk is that the connection pool itself will be a bottleneck in your application.

But leaving it unlimited isn’t necessarily the best thing to do. By default PostgreSQL has a hard limit of 100 open connections and, if this hard limit is hit under heavy load, it will cause our pq driver to return a "sorry, too many clients already" error.

**Note**: The hard limit on open connections can be changed in your postgresql.conf file using the max_connections setting.

To avoid this error, it makes sense limit the number of open connections in our pool to comfortably below 100 — leaving enough headroom for any other applications or sessions that also need to use PostgreSQL.

The other benefit of setting a MaxOpenConns limit is that it acts as a very rudimentary throttle, and prevents the database from being swamped by a huge number of tasks all at once.

But setting a limit comes with an important caveat. If the MaxOpenConns limit is reached, and all connections are in-use, then any further database tasks will be forced to wait until a connection becomes free and marked as idle. In the context of our API, the user’s HTTP request could ‘hang’ indefinitely while waiting for a free connection. So to mitigate this, it’s important to always set a timeout on database tasks using a context.Context object.

##### The SetMaxIdleConns method

The [SetMaxIdleConns()](https://pkg.go.dev/database/sql#DB.SetMaxIdleConns) method sets an upper MaxIdleConns limit on the number of idle connections in the pool. By default, the maximum number of idle connections is 2. 

As a guideline: you only want to keep a connection idle if you’re likely to be using it again soon.

##### The SetConnMaxLifetime method

The [SetConnMaxLifetime()](https://pkg.go.dev/database/sql#DB.SetConnMaxLifetime) method sets the ConnMaxLifetime limit — the maximum length of time that a connection can be reused for. By default, there’s no maximum lifetime and connections will be reused forever.

If we set ConnMaxLifetime to one hour, for example, it means that all connections will be marked as ‘expired’ one hour after they were first created, and cannot be reused after they’ve expired. But note: 

- This doesn’t guarantee that a connection will exist in the pool for a whole hour; it’s possible that a connection will become unusable for some reason and be automatically closed before then.
- A connection can still be in use more than one hour after being created — it just cannot start to be reused after that time.
- This isn’t an idle timeout. The connection will expire one hour after it was first created —not one hour after it last became idle.
- Once every second Go runs a background cleanup operation to remove expired connections from the pool.

In theory, leaving ConnMaxLifetime unlimited (or setting a long lifetime) will help performance because it makes it less likely that new connections will need to be created from scratch. But in certain situations, it can be useful to enforce a shorter lifetime. For example: 

- If your SQL database enforces a maximum lifetime on connections, it makes sense to set ConnMaxLifetime to a slightly shorter value.
- To help facilitate swapping databases gracefully behind a load balancer.

##### The SetConnMaxIdleTime method

The [SetConnMaxIdleTime()](https://pkg.go.dev/database/sql#DB.SetConnMaxIdleTime) method sets the ConnMaxIdleTime limit. This works in a very similar way to ConnMaxLifetime, except it sets the maximum length of time that a connection can be idle for before it is marked as expired. By default there’s no limit.

If we set ConnMaxIdleTime to 1 hour, for example, any connections that have sat idle in the pool for 1 hour since last being used will be marked as expired and removed by the background cleanup operation.

This setting is really useful because it means that we can set a relatively high limit on the number of idle connections in the pool, but periodically free-up resources by removing any idle connections that we know aren’t really being used anymore.

#### Putting it into practice

Let’s summarize all the above into some actionable points.

1. As a rule of thumb, you should explicitly set a MaxOpenConns value. This should be comfortably below any hard limits on the number of connections imposed by your database and infrastructure, and you may also want to consider keeping it fairly low to act as a rudimentary throttle. 

   For this project we’ll set a MaxOpenConns limit of 25 connections. I’ve found this to be a reasonable starting point for small-to-medium web applications and APIs, but ideally you should tweak this value for your hardware depending on the results of benchmarking and load-testing.

2. In general, higher MaxOpenConns and MaxIdleConns values will lead to better performance. But the returns are diminishing, and you should be aware that having a too-large idle connection pool (with connections that are not frequently re-used) can actually lead to reduced performance and unnecessary resource consumption.

   Because MaxIdleConns should always be less than or equal to MaxOpenConns, we’ll also limit MaxIdleConns to 25 connections for this project.

3. To mitigate the risk from point 2 above, you should generally set a ConnMaxIdleTime value to remove idle connections that haven’t been used for a long time. In this project we’ll set a ConnMaxIdleTime duration of 15 minutes.

4. It’s probably OK to leave ConnMaxLifetime as unlimited, unless your database imposes a hard limit on connection lifetime, or you need it specifically to facilitate something like gracefully swapping databases. Neither of those things apply in this project, so we’ll leave this as the default unlimited setting.

#### Configuring the connection pool

```go
// File: cmd/api/main.go 

package main 

...

// Add maxOpenConns, maxIdleConns and maxIdleTime fields to hold the configuration 
// settings for the connection pool.
type config struct {   
  port int   
  env  string  
  db   struct {  
    dsn          string     
    maxOpenConns int      
    maxIdleConns int      
    maxIdleTime  time.Duration  
  }
}

...

func main() {  
  var cfg config  
  
  flag.IntVar(&cfg.port, "port", 4000, "API server port")  
  flag.StringVar(&cfg.env, "env", "development", "Environment (development|staging|production)")   
  
  flag.StringVar(&cfg.db.dsn, "db-dsn", os.Getenv("GREENLIGHT_DB_DSN"), "PostgreSQL DSN")  
  
  // Read the connection pool settings from command-line flags into the config struct.
  // Notice that the default values we're using are the ones we discussed above?    
  flag.IntVar(&cfg.db.maxOpenConns, "db-max-open-conns", 25, "PostgreSQL max open connections")    
  flag.IntVar(&cfg.db.maxIdleConns, "db-max-idle-conns", 25, "PostgreSQL max idle connections")  
  flag.DurationVar(&cfg.db.maxIdleTime, "db-max-idle-time", 15*time.Minute, "PostgreSQL max connection idle time")   
  
  flag.Parse()   
  
  ...
  
} 

func openDB(cfg config) (*sql.DB, error) {  
  db, err := sql.Open("postgres", cfg.db.dsn)   
  if err != nil {     
    return nil, err  
  }    
  
  // Set the maximum number of open (in-use + idle) connections in the pool. Note that 
  // passing a value less than or equal to 0 will mean there is no limit.
  db.SetMaxOpenConns(cfg.db.maxOpenConns)   
  
  // Set the maximum number of idle connections in the pool. Again, passing a value 
  // less than or equal to 0 will mean there is no limit.
  db.SetMaxIdleConns(cfg.db.maxIdleConns)   
  
  // Set the maximum idle timeout for connections in the pool. Passing a duration less  
  // than or equal to 0 will mean that connections are not closed due to their idle time. 
  db.SetConnMaxIdleTime(cfg.db.maxIdleTime)  
  
  ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), 5*time.Second)  
  defer cancel()   
  
  err = db.PingContext(ctx)   
  if err != nil {    
    db.Close()     
    return nil, err   
  }   
  
  return db, nil 
}
```
