## Database-driven responses

### Setting up MySQL

```sql
-- Create a new UTF-8 `snippetbox` database.
CREATE DATABASE snippetbox CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci; 

-- Switch to using the `snippetbox` database.
USE snippetbox;
```

```sql
-- Create a `snippets` table.
CREATE TABLE snippets ( 
  id INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,  
  title VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,  
  content TEXT NOT NULL,  
  created DATETIME NOT NULL,  
  expires DATETIME NOT NULL 
); 

-- Add an index on the created column.
CREATE INDEX idx_snippets_created ON snippets(created);
```

```sql
-- Add some dummy records (which we'll use in the next couple of chapters).
INSERT INTO snippets (title, content, created, expires) VALUES ( 
  'An old silent pond',    
  'An old silent pond...\nA frog jumps into the pond,\nsplash! Silence again.\n\n– Matsuo Bashō',   
  UTC_TIMESTAMP(),   
  DATE_ADD(UTC_TIMESTAMP(), INTERVAL 365 DAY) 
);

INSERT INTO snippets (title, content, created, expires) VALUES (   
  'Over the wintry forest',   
  'Over the wintry\nforest, winds howl in rage\nwith no leaves to blow.\n\n– Natsume Soseki',   UTC_TIMESTAMP(),  
  DATE_ADD(UTC_TIMESTAMP(), INTERVAL 365 DAY) 
); 

INSERT INTO snippets (title, content, created, expires) VALUES (  
  'First autumn morning',   
  'First autumn morning\nthe mirror I stare into\nshows my father''s face.\n\n– Murakami Kijo',   
  UTC_TIMESTAMP(),  
  DATE_ADD(UTC_TIMESTAMP(), INTERVAL 7 DAY) 
);
```

#### Creating a new user

```sql
CREATE USER 'web'@'localhost'; 
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON snippetbox.* TO 'web'@'localhost'; 
-- Important: Make sure to swap 'pass' with a password of your own choosing.
ALTER USER 'web'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'pass';
```

#### Test the new user

```bash
$ mysql -D snippetbox -u web -p
```

### Installing a database driver

You can find a comprehensive [list of available drivers](https://go.dev/wiki/SQLDrivers) on the Go wiki, but for our application we’ll use the popular `go-sql-driver/mysql` driver.

```bash
$ go get github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql
```

### Modules and reproducible builds

You (or someone else in the future) can run `go mod download` to download the exact versions of all the packages that your project needs.

You can run `go mod verify` to ensure that nothing in those downloaded packages has been changed unexpectedly.

Whenever you run `go run`, `go test` or `go build`, the exact package versions listed in `go.mod` will always be used.

#### Additional information

##### Upgrading packages

To upgrade to latest available minor or patch release of a package, you can simply run `go get` with the -u flag like so:

```bash
$ go get -u github.com/foo/bar
```

Or alternatively, if you want to upgrade to a specific version then you should run the same command but with the appropriate `@version` suffix. For example:

```bash
$ go get -u github.com/foo/bar@v2.0.0
```

##### Removing unused packages

You could either run go get and postfix the package path with `@none`, like so:

```bash
$ go get github.com/foo/bar@none
```

Or if you’ve removed all references to the package in your code, you could run `go mod tidy`, which will automatically remove any unused packages from your `go.mod` and go.sum files.

```bash
$ go mod tidy -v
```

### Creating a database connection pool

```go
// File: cmd/web/main.go 

package main 
import ( 
  "database/sql" // New import  
  "flag"   
  "log" 
  "net/http"   
  "os"  
  
  _ "github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql" // New import 
)

...

func main() {  
  addr := flag.String("addr", ":4000", "HTTP network address")  
  // Define a new command-line flag for the MySQL DSN string.
  dsn := flag.String("dsn", "web:pass@/snippetbox?parseTime=true", "MySQL data source name")        
  flag.Parse()  
  
  infoLog := log.New(os.Stdout, "INFO\t", log.Ldate|log.Ltime)  
  errorLog := log.New(os.Stderr, "ERROR\t", log.Ldate|log.Ltime|log.Lshortfile) 
  
  // To keep the main() function tidy I've put the code for creating a connection   
  // pool into the separate openDB() function below. We pass openDB() the DSN  
  // from the command-line flag.
  db, err := openDB(*dsn) 
  if err != nil {    
    errorLog.Fatal(err)  
  }    
  
  // We also defer a call to db.Close(), so that the connection pool is closed  
  // before the main() function exits.
  defer db.Close()   
  
  app := &application{    
    errorLog: errorLog,     
    infoLog:  infoLog,  
  }    
  
  srv := &http.Server{    
    Addr:     *addr,     
    ErrorLog: errorLog,     
    Handler:  app.routes(),    
  }    
  
  infoLog.Printf("Starting server on %s", *addr)   
  // Because the err variable is now already declared in the code above, we need   
  // to use the assignment operator = here, instead of the := 'declare and assign'   
  // operator.
  err = srv.ListenAndServe()  
  errorLog.Fatal(err) 
} 

// The openDB() function wraps sql.Open() and returns a sql.DB connection pool 
// for a given DSN.
func openDB(dsn string) (*sql.DB, error) {  
  db, err := sql.Open("mysql", dsn)  
  if err != nil {   
    return nil, err  
  }   
  if err = db.Ping(); err != nil {    
    return nil, err   
  }    
  return db, nil 
}
```

### Designing a database model

```go
// File: internal/models/snippets.go 

package models 

import ( 
  "database/sql"  
  "time" 
) 

// Define a Snippet type to hold the data for an individual snippet. Notice how 
// the fields of the struct correspond to the fields in our MySQL snippets table.
type Snippet struct { 
  ID      int  
  Title   string  
  Content string   
  Created time.Time  
  Expires time.Time 
} 

// Define a SnippetModel type which wraps a sql.DB connection pool.
type SnippetModel struct {  
  DB *sql.DB 
} 

// This will insert a new snippet into the database.
func (m *SnippetModel) Insert(title string, content string, expires int) (int, error) {  
  return 0, nil 
} 

// This will return a specific snippet based on its id.
func (m *SnippetModel) Get(id int) (*Snippet, error) {  
  return nil, nil
} 

// This will return the 10 most recently created snippets.
func (m *SnippetModel) Latest() ([]*Snippet, error) {  
  return nil, nil 
}
```

#### Using the SnippetModel

```go
// File: cmd/web/main.go 

package main 

import (   
  "database/sql"   
  "flag"  
  "log"     
  "net/http"  
  "os"   
  
  // Import the models package that we just created. You need to prefix this with  
  // whatever module path you set up back in chapter 02.01 (Project Setup and Creating  
  // a Module) so that the import statement looks like this:   
  // "{your-module-path}/internal/models". If you can't remember what module path you  
  // used, you can find it at the top of the go.mod file.
  "snippetbox.alexedwards.net/internal/models"   
  
  _ "github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql" 
) 

// Add a snippets field to the application struct. This will allow us to 
// make the SnippetModel object available to our handlers.
type application struct {  
  errorLog *log.Logger  
  infoLog  *log.Logger   
  snippets *models.SnippetModel 
}

func main() {   
  addr := flag.String("addr", ":4000", "HTTP network address")   
  dsn := flag.String("dsn", "web:pass@/snippetbox?parseTime=true", "MySQL data source name")     
  flag.Parse()  
  
  infoLog := log.New(os.Stdout, "INFO\t", log.Ldate|log.Ltime)  
  errorLog := log.New(os.Stderr, "ERROR\t", log.Ldate|log.Ltime|log.Lshortfile)  
  
  db, err := openDB(*dsn)  
  if err != nil {    
    errorLog.Fatal(err)   
  }    
  defer db.Close()   
  
  // Initialize a models.SnippetModel instance and add it to the application dependencies.
  app := &application{      
    errorLog: errorLog,    
    infoLog:  infoLog,     
    snippets: &models.SnippetModel{DB: db}, 
  }   
  
  srv := &http.Server{    
    Addr:     *addr,   
    ErrorLog: errorLog,     
    Handler:  app.routes(),   
  } 
  
  infoLog.Printf("Starting server on %s", *addr)  
  err = srv.ListenAndServe()   
  errorLog.Fatal(err) 
}

...
```

Benefits of this structure: 

- There’s a clean separation of concerns. Our database logic isn’t tied to our handlers which means that handler responsibilities are limited to HTTP stuff (i.e. validating requests and writing responses). This will make it easier to write tight, focused, unit tests in the future.
- By creating a custom `SnippetModel` type and implementing methods on it we’ve been able to make our model a single, neatly encapsulated object, which we can easily initialize and then pass to our handlers as a dependency. Again, this makes for easier to maintain, testable code.
- Because the model actions are defined as methods on an object — in our case SnippetModel — there’s the opportunity to create an interface and mock it for unit testing purposes.
- And finally, we have total control over which database is used at runtime, just by using the `-dsn` command-line flag.

### Executing SQL statements

#### Executing the query

Go provides three different methods for executing database queries:

- `DB.Query()` is used for `SELECT` queries which return multiple rows.
- `DB.QueryRow()` is used for `SELECT` queries which return a single row.
- `DB.Exec()` is used for statements which don’t return rows (like `INSERT` and `DELETE`).

```go
// File: internal/models/snippets.go 

package models

...

type SnippetModel struct {  
  DB *sql.DB 
}

func (m *SnippetModel) Insert(title string, content string, expires int) (int, error) {  
  // Write the SQL statement we want to execute. I've split it over two lines  
  // for readability (which is why it's surrounded with backquotes instead  
  // of normal double quotes).
  stmt := `INSERT INTO snippets (title, content, created, expires)   
  VALUES(?, ?, UTC_TIMESTAMP(), DATE_ADD(UTC_TIMESTAMP(), INTERVAL ? DAY))` 
  
  // Use the Exec() method on the embedded connection pool to execute the  
  // statement. The first parameter is the SQL statement, followed by the   
  // title, content and expiry values for the placeholder parameters. This   
  // method returns a sql.Result type, which contains some basic   
  // information about what happened when the statement was executed.
  result, err := m.DB.Exec(stmt, title, content, expires)    
  if err != nil {    
    return 0, err  
  }    
  
  // Use the LastInsertId() method on the result to get the ID of our 
  // newly inserted record in the snippets table. Not all drivers and databases 
  // support the LastInsertId() and RowsAffected() methods. For example, 
  // LastInsertId() is not supported by PostgreSQL.
  id, err := result.LastInsertId()    
  if err != nil {    
    return 0, err  
  }    
  
  // The ID returned has the type int64, so we convert it to an int type  
  // before returning.
  return int(id), nil 
}

...
```

The placeholder parameter syntax differs depending on your database. MySQL, SQL Server and SQLite use the `?` notation, but PostgreSQL uses the `$N` notation. For example, if you were using PostgreSQL instead you would write:

```go
_, err := m.DB.Exec("INSERT INTO ... VALUES ($1, $2, $3)", ...)
```

#### Using the model in our handlers

```go
// File: cmd/web/handlers.go 

package main

...

func (app *application) snippetCreate(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {   
  if r.Method != http.MethodPost {      
    w.Header().Set("Allow", http.MethodPost)   
    app.clientError(w, http.StatusMethodNotAllowed)    
    return    
  }   
  
  // Create some variables holding dummy data. We'll remove these later on  
  // during the build.
  title := "O snail"   
  content := "O snail\nClimb Mount Fuji,\nBut slowly, slowly!\n\n– Kobayashi Issa"   
  expires := 7    
  
  // Pass the data to the SnippetModel.Insert() method, receiving the 
  // ID of the new record back.
  id, err := app.snippets.Insert(title, content, expires)   
  if err != nil {      
    app.serverError(w, err)     
    return   
  }    
  
  // Redirect the user to the relevant page for the snippet.
  http.Redirect(w, r, fmt.Sprintf("/snippet/view?id=%d", id), http.StatusSeeOther) 
}
```

#### Single-record SQL queries

```go
// File: internal/models/snippets.go 

package models 

import (
  "database/sql"    
  "errors" // New import  
  "time" 
) 

...

func (m *SnippetModel) Get(id int) (*Snippet, error) {   
  // Write the SQL statement we want to execute.
  stmt := `SELECT id, title, content, created, expires FROM snippets   
  WHERE expires > UTC_TIMESTAMP() AND id = ?`  
  
  // Use the QueryRow() method on the connection pool to execute our 
  // SQL statement, passing in the untrusted id variable as the value for the  
  // placeholder parameter. This returns a pointer to a sql.Row object which  
  // holds the result from the database.
  row := m.DB.QueryRow(stmt, id)   
  
  // Initialize a pointer to a new zeroed Snippet struct.
  s := &Snippet{}  
  
  // Use row.Scan() to copy the values from each field in sql.Row to the 
  // corresponding field in the Snippet struct. Notice that the arguments 
  // to row.Scan are *pointers* to the place you want to copy the data into, 
  // and the number of arguments must be exactly the same as the number of  
  // columns returned by your statement.
  err := row.Scan(&s.ID, &s.Title, &s.Content, &s.Created, &s.Expires)  
  if err != nil {     
    // If the query returns no rows, then row.Scan() will return a     
    // sql.ErrNoRows error. We use the errors.Is() function check for that   
    // error specifically, and return our own ErrNoRecord error    
    // instead (we'll create this in a moment).
    if errors.Is(err, sql.ErrNoRows) {   
      return nil, ErrNoRecord     
    } else {      
      return nil, err    
    }
  }
  
  // If everything went OK then return the Snippet object.
  return s, nil 
}

...
```

Behind the scenes of rows.Scan() your driver will automatically convert the raw output from the SQL database to the required native Go types. So long as you’re sensible with the types that you’re mapping between SQL and Go, these conversions should generally Just Work. Usually:

- CHAR, VARCHAR and TEXT map to string.
- BOOLEAN maps to bool.
- INT maps to int; BIGINT maps to int64.
- DECIMAL and NUMERIC map to float.
- TIME, DATE and TIMESTAMP map to time.Time.

Note: A quirk of our MySQL driver is that we need to use the `parseTime=true` parameter in our DSN to force it to convert TIME and DATE fields to `time.Time`. Otherwise it returns these as `[]byte` objects. This is one of the many [driver-specific parameters](https://github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql/?tab=readme-ov-file#parsetime) that it offers.

```go
// File: internal/models/errors.go 

package models 

import (  
  "errors"
) 

var ErrNoRecord = errors.New("models: no matching record found")
```

#### Using the model in our handlers

```go
// File: cmd/web/handlers.go 

package main 

import (   
  "errors" // New import   
  "fmt"  
  "html/template"  
  "net/http"   
  "strconv"  
  
  "snippetbox.alexedwards.net/internal/models" // New import 
)

...

func (app *application) snippetView(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {  
  id, err := strconv.Atoi(r.URL.Query().Get("id"))   
  if err != nil || id < 1 {    
    app.notFound(w)    
    return  
  }   
  
  // Use the SnippetModel object's Get method to retrieve the data for a  
  // specific record based on its ID. If no matching record is found,  
  // return a 404 Not Found response.
  snippet, err := app.snippets.Get(id)   
  if err != nil {      
    if errors.Is(err, models.ErrNoRecord) {    
      app.notFound(w)      
    } else {     
      app.serverError(w, err)    
    }      
    return   
  }    
  
  // Write the snippet data as a plain-text HTTP response body.
  fmt.Fprintf(w, "%+v", snippet) 
} 

...
```

### Multiple-record SQL queries

```go
// File: internal/models/snippets.go 

package models 

...

func (m *SnippetModel) Latest() ([]*Snippet, error) {  
  // Write the SQL statement we want to execute.
  stmt := `SELECT id, title, content, created, expires FROM snippets   
  WHERE expires > UTC_TIMESTAMP() ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT 10`  
  
  // Use the Query() method on the connection pool to execute our   
  // SQL statement. This returns a sql.Rows resultset containing the result of  
  // our query.
  rows, err := m.DB.Query(stmt)  
  if err != nil {      
    return nil, err  
  }    
  
  // We defer rows.Close() to ensure the sql.Rows resultset is   
  // always properly closed before the Latest() method returns. This defer   
  // statement should come *after* you check for an error from the Query()  
  // method. Otherwise, if Query() returns an error, you'll get a panic  
  // trying to close a nil resultset.
  defer rows.Close()  
  
  // Initialize an empty slice to hold the Snippet structs.
  snippets := []*Snippet{}   
  
  // Use rows.Next to iterate through the rows in the resultset. This   
  // prepares the first (and then each subsequent) row to be acted on by the 
  // rows.Scan() method. If iteration over all the rows completes then the  
  // resultset automatically closes itself and frees-up the underlying  
  // database connection.
  for rows.Next() {     
    // Create a pointer to a new zeroed Snippet struct.
    s := &Snippet{}     
    // Use rows.Scan() to copy the values from each field in the row to the     
    // new Snippet object that we created. Again, the arguments to row.Scan()   
    // must be pointers to the place you want to copy the data into, and the    
    // number of arguments must be exactly the same as the number of     
    // columns returned by your statement.
    err = rows.Scan(&s.ID, &s.Title, &s.Content, &s.Created, &s.Expires)     
    if err != nil {          
      return nil, err  
    }       
    // Append it to the slice of snippets.
    snippets = append(snippets, s)   
  }   
  
  // When the rows.Next() loop has finished we call rows.Err() to retrieve any  
  // error that was encountered during the iteration. It's important to   
  // call this - don't assume that a successful iteration was completed   
  // over the whole resultset.
  if err = rows.Err(); err != nil {    
    return nil, err  
  }  
  
  // If everything went OK then return the Snippets slice.
  return snippets, nil
}
```

**Important**: Closing a resultset with `defer rows.Close()` is critical in the code above. As long as a resultset is open it will keep the underlying database connection open… so if something goes wrong in this method and the resultset isn’t closed, it can rapidly lead to all the connections in your pool being used up.

#### Using the model in our handlers

```go
// File: cmd/web/handlers.go 

package main 

import (  
  "errors"  
  "fmt"   
  // "html/template"   
  "net/http"    
  "strconv"   
  
  "snippetbox.alexedwards.net/internal/models" 
) 

func (app *application) home(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) { 
  if r.URL.Path != "/" {     
    app.notFound(w)  
    return   
  }   
  
  snippets, err := app.snippets.Latest()  
  if err != nil {      
    app.serverError(w, err)    
    return   
  }  
  
  for _, snippet := range snippets {  
    fmt.Fprintf(w, "%+v\n", snippet)   
  }   
  
  // files := []string{    
  //     "./ui/html/base.tmpl",    
  //     "./ui/html/partials/nav.tmpl",   
  //     "./ui/html/pages/home.tmpl",    
  // }   
  
  // ts, err := template.ParseFiles(files...)  
  // if err != nil {   
  //     app.serverError(w, err)   
  //     return    
  // }   
  
  // err = ts.ExecuteTemplate(w, "base", nil)    
  // if err != nil {   
  //     app.serverError(w, err)   
  // } 
}

...
```

### Transactions and other details

#### The database/sql package

So long as you use the database/sql package, the Go code you write will generally be portable and will work with any kind of SQL database — whether it’s MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite or something else. This means that your application isn’t so tightly coupled to the database that you’re currently using, and the theory is that you can swap databases in the future without re-writing all of your code (driver-specific quirks and SQL implementations aside).

#### Verbosity

If you’re coming from Ruby, Python or PHP, the code for querying SQL databases may feel a bit verbose, especially if you’re used to dealing with an abstraction layer or ORM.

If the verbosity really is starting to grate on you, you might want to consider trying the [jmoiron/sqlx](https://github.com/jmoiron/sqlx) package. It’s well designed and provides some good extensions that make working with SQL queries quicker and easier. Another, newer, option you may want to consider is the [blockloop/scan](https://github.com/blockloop/scan) package.

#### Managing null values

One thing that Go doesn’t do very well is managing NULL values in database records.

Let’s pretend that the title column in our snippets table contains a NULL value in a particular row. If we queried that row, then `rows.Scan()` would return an error because it can’t convert NULL into a string.

Very roughly, the fix for this is to change the field that you’re are scanning into from a string to a sql.NullString type. See [this gist](https://gist.github.com/alexedwards/dc3145c8e2e6d2fd6cd9) for a working example.

But, as a rule, the easiest thing to do is simply avoid NULL values altogether. Set NOT NULL constraints on all your database columns, like we have done in this book, along with sensible DEFAULT values as necessary.

#### Working with transactions

t’s important to realize that calls to `Exec()`, `Query()` and `QueryRow()` can use any connection from the `sql.DB` pool. Even if you have two calls to `Exec()` immediately next to each other in your code, there is no guarantee that they will use the same database connection.

Sometimes this isn’t acceptable. For instance, if you lock a table with MySQL’s `LOCK TABLES` command you must call `UNLOCK TABLES` on exactly the same connection to avoid a **deadlock**.

To guarantee that the same connection is used you can wrap multiple statements in a transaction. Here’s the basic pattern:

```go
type ExampleModel struct {  
  DB *sql.DB
} 

func (m *ExampleModel) ExampleTransaction() error {  
  // Calling the Begin() method on the connection pool creates a new sql.Tx   
  // object, which represents the in-progress database transaction.
  tx, err := m.DB.Begin()  
  if err != nil {     
    return err  
  }   
  
  // Defer a call to tx.Rollback() to ensure it is always called before the  
  // function returns. If the transaction succeeds it will be already be  
  // committed by the time tx.Rollback() is called, making tx.Rollback() a  
  // no-op. Otherwise, in the event of an error, tx.Rollback() will rollback  
  // the changes before the function returns.
  defer tx.Rollback()   
  
  // Call Exec() on the transaction, passing in your statement and any  
  // parameters. It's important to notice that tx.Exec() is called on the   
  // transaction object just created, NOT the connection pool. Although we're  
  // using tx.Exec() here you can also use tx.Query() and tx.QueryRow() in   
  // exactly the same way.
  _, err = tx.Exec("INSERT INTO ...")   
  if err != nil {  
    return err  
  }    
  
  // Carry out another transaction in exactly the same way.
  _, err = tx.Exec("UPDATE ...")  
  if err != nil {     
    return err   
  }    
  
  // If there are no errors, the statements in the transaction can be committed  
  // to the database with the tx.Commit() method. 
  err = tx.Commit() 
  return err 
}

**Important**: You must always call either Rollback() or Commit() before your function returns. If you don’t the connection will stay open and not be returned to the connection pool. This can lead to hitting your maximum connection limit/running out of resources. The simplest way to avoid this is to use defer tx.Rollback() like we are in the example above.

#### Prepared statements

As I mentioned earlier, the Exec(), Query() and QueryRow() methods all use prepared statements behind the scenes to help prevent SQL injection attacks. They set up a prepared statement on the database connection, run it with the parameters provided, and then close the prepared statement.

This might feel rather inefficient because we are creating and recreating the same prepared statements every single time.

In theory, a better approach could be to make use of the [DB.Prepare()](https://pkg.go.dev/database/sql@go1.23.2#DB.Prepare) method to create our own prepared statement once, and reuse that instead. This is particularly true for complex SQL statements (e.g. those which have multiple JOINS) and are repeated very often (e.g. a bulk insert of tens of thousands of records). In these instances, the cost of re-preparing statements may have a noticeable effect on run time.

Here’s the basic pattern for using your own prepared statement in a web application:

```go
// We need somewhere to store the prepared statement for the lifetime of our 
// web application. A neat way is to embed in the model alongside the connection pool.
type ExampleModel struct {   
  DB         *sql.DB   
  InsertStmt *sql.Stmt 
} 

// Create a constructor for the model, in which we set up the prepared statement.
func NewExampleModel(db *sql.DB) (*ExampleModel, error) {  
  // Use the Prepare method to create a new prepared statement for the  
  // current connection pool. This returns a sql.Stmt object which represents   
  // the prepared statement.
  insertStmt, err := db.Prepare("INSERT INTO ...")   
  if err != nil {     
    return nil, err   
  }   
  
  // Store it in our ExampleModel object, alongside the connection pool.
  return &ExampleModel{db, insertStmt}, nil 
}

// Any methods implemented against the ExampleModel object will have access to 
// the prepared statement.
func (m *ExampleModel) Insert(args...) error {   
  // Notice how we call Exec directly against the prepared statement, rather  
  // than against the connection pool. Prepared statements also support the   
  // Query and QueryRow methods.
  _, err := m.InsertStmt.Exec(args...)   
  return err 
} 

// In the web application's main function we will need to initialize a new 
// ExampleModel struct using the constructor function.
func main() {  
  db, err := sql.Open(...)   
  if err != nil {    
    errorLog.Fatal(err)  
  }   
  defer db.Close()   
  
  // Create a new ExampleModel object, which includes the prepared statement.
  exampleModel, err := NewExampleModel(db) 
  if err != nil {    
    errorLog.Fatal(err)   
  }   
  
  // Defer a call to Close() on the prepared statement to ensure that it is  
  // properly closed before our main function terminates.
  defer exampleModel.InsertStmt.Close() 
}
```
