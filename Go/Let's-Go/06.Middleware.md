### How middleware works

#### The pattern

```go
func myMiddleware(next http.Handler) http.Handler {  
  fn := func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {    
    // TODO: Execute our middleware logic here...
    next.ServeHTTP(w, r)   
  }  
  
  return http.HandlerFunc(fn)
}
```

#### Simplifying the middleware

```go
func myMiddleware(next http.Handler) http.Handler {  
  return http.HandlerFunc(func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {    
    // TODO: Execute our middleware logic here...
    next.ServeHTTP(w, r)   
  })
}
```

#### Positioning the middleware

If you position your middleware before the servemux in the chain then it will act on every request that your application receives.

```
myMiddleware → servemux → application handler
```

A good example of where this would be useful is middleware to log requests — as that’s typically something you would want to do for all requests.

Alternatively, you can position the middleware after the servemux in the chain — by wrapping a specific application handler. This would cause your middleware to only be executed for a specific route.

```
servemux → myMiddleware → application handler
```

An example of this would be something like authorization middleware, which you may only want to run on specific routes.

### Setting security headers

Let’s put the pattern we learned in the previous chapter to use, and make our own middleware which automatically adds the following HTTP security headers to every response, in line with [OWASP guidance](https://owasp.org/www-project-secure-headers/).

```
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; style-src 'self' fonts.googleapis.com; font-src fonts.gstatic.com 
Referrer-Policy: origin-when-cross-origin 
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff 
X-Frame-Options: deny 
X-XSS-Protection: 0
```

Content-Security-Policy (often abbreviated to CSP) headers are used to restrict where the resources for your web page (e.g. JavaScript, images, fonts etc) can be loaded from. Setting a strict CSP policy helps prevent a variety of cross-site scripting, clickjacking, and other code-injection attacks. CSP headers and how they work is a big topic, and I recommend reading [this primer](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP) if you haven’t come across them before. But, in our case, the header tells the browser that it’s OK to load fonts from fonts.gstatic.com, stylesheets from fonts.googleapis.com and self (our own origin), and then everything else only from self. Inline JavaScript is blocked by default

Referrer-Policy is used to control what information is included in a Referer header when a user navigates away from your web page. In our case, we’ll set the value to origin-when-cross-origin, which means that the full URL will be included for [same-origin requests](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Same-origin_policy), but for all other requests information like the URL path and any query string values will be stripped out.

X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff instructs browsers to not MIME-type sniff the contenttype of the response, which in turn helps to prevent [content-sniffing attacks](https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/7506/using-file-extension-and-mime-type-as-output-by-file-i-b-combination-to-dete/7531%237531).

X-Frame-Options: deny is used to help prevent clickjacking attacks in older browsers that don’t support CSP headers.

X-XSS-Protection: 0 is used to disable the blocking of cross-site scripting attacks. Previously it was good practice to set this header to X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block, but when you’re using CSP headers like we are the recommendation is to disable this feature altogether.

```go
// File: cmd/web/middleware.go 

package main

import ( 
  "net/http" 
)

func secureHeaders(next http.Handler) http.Handler { 
  return http.HandlerFunc(func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {   
    // Note: This is split across multiple lines for readability. You don't   
    // need to do this in your own code.
    w.Header().Set("Content-Security-Policy",  
    "default-src 'self'; style-src 'self' fonts.googleapis.com; font-src fonts.gstatic.com")
    
    w.Header().Set("Referrer-Policy", "origin-when-cross-origin")    
    w.Header().Set("X-Content-Type-Options", "nosniff")    
    w.Header().Set("X-Frame-Options", "deny")     
    w.Header().Set("X-XSS-Protection", "0")   
    
    next.ServeHTTP(w, r)   
  })
}
```

Because we want this middleware to act on every request that is received, we need it to be executed before a request hits our servemux. To do this we’ll need the secureHeaders middleware function to wrap our servemux.

```go
// File: cmd/web/routes.go 

package main 

import "net/http" 

// Update the signature for the routes() method so that it returns a 
// http.Handler instead of *http.ServeMux.
func (app *application) routes() http.Handler {  
  mux := http.NewServeMux()   
  
  fileServer := http.FileServer(http.Dir("./ui/static/"))  
  mux.Handle("/static/", http.StripPrefix("/static", fileServer))  
  
  mux.HandleFunc("/", app.home)   
  mux.HandleFunc("/snippet/view", app.snippetView)  
  mux.HandleFunc("/snippet/create", app.snippetCreate)   
  
  // Pass the servemux as the 'next' parameter to the secureHeaders middleware.
  // Because secureHeaders is just a function, and the function returns a   
  // http.Handler we don't need to do anything else.
  return secureHeaders(mux)
}
```

#### Additional information

##### Flow of control

It’s important to know that when the last handler in the chain returns, control is passed back up the chain in the reverse direction. So when our code is being executed the flow of control actually looks like this:

```
secureHeaders → servemux → application handler → servemux → secureHeaders
```

In any middleware handler, code which comes before next.ServeHTTP() will be executed on the way down the chain, and any code after next.ServeHTTP() — or in a deferred function —will be executed on the way back up.

```go
func myMiddleware(next http.Handler) http.Handler {   
  return http.HandlerFunc(func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {    
    // Any code here will execute on the way down the chain.
    next.ServeHTTP(w, r)      
    // Any code here will execute on the way back up the chain.
    })
}
```

##### Early returns

Another thing to mention is that if you call return in your middleware function before you call next.ServeHTTP(), then the chain will stop being executed and control will flow back upstream.

As an example, a common use-case for early returns is authentication middleware which only allows execution of the chain to continue if a particular check is passed. For instance:

```go
func myMiddleware(next http.Handler) http.Handler {   
  return http.HandlerFunc(func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {  
    // If the user isn't authorized send a 403 Forbidden status and     
    // return to stop executing the chain.
    if !isAuthorized(r) {       
      w.WriteHeader(http.StatusForbidden)     
      return     
    }    
    
    // Otherwise, call the next handler in the chain.
    next.ServeHTTP(w, r)    
  })
}
```

### Request logging

```go
// File: cmd/web/middleware.go 

package main 

...

func (app *application) logRequest(next http.Handler) http.Handler { 
  return http.HandlerFunc(func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {  
    app.infoLog.Printf("%s - %s %s %s", r.RemoteAddr, r.Proto, r.Method, r.URL.RequestURI())        
    next.ServeHTTP(w, r)  
  })
}
```

```go
// File: cmd/web/routes.go 

package main

import "net/http" 

func (app *application) routes() http.Handler { 
  mux := http.NewServeMux()   
  
  fileServer := http.FileServer(http.Dir("./ui/static/")) 
  mux.Handle("/static/", http.StripPrefix("/static", fileServer))   
  
  mux.HandleFunc("/", app.home)   
  mux.HandleFunc("/snippet/view", app.snippetView)  
  mux.HandleFunc("/snippet/create", app.snippetCreate) 
  
  // Wrap the existing chain with the logRequest middleware.
  return app.logRequest(secureHeaders(mux)) 
}
```

### Panic recovery

```go
// File: cmd/web/middleware.go 

package main 

import (  
  "fmt" // New import   
  "net/http" 
)

...

func (app *application) recoverPanic(next http.Handler) http.Handler {  
  return http.HandlerFunc(func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {  
    // Create a deferred function (which will always be run in the event    
    // of a panic as Go unwinds the stack).
    defer func() {      
      // Use the builtin recover function to check if there has been a     
      // panic or not. If there has...
      if err := recover(); err != nil {   
        // Set a "Connection: close" header on the response.
        w.Header().Set("Connection", "close")    
        // Call the app.serverError helper method to return a 500     
        // Internal Server response.
        app.serverError(w, fmt.Errorf("%s", err))    
      }     
    }()     
    
    next.ServeHTTP(w, r)  
  }) 
}
```

There are two details about this which are worth explaining:  

- Setting the `Connection: Close` header on the response acts as a trigger to make Go’s HTTP server automatically close the current connection after a response has been sent. It also informs the user that the connection will be closed. Note: If the protocol being used is HTTP/2, Go will automatically strip the `Connection: Close` header from the response (so it is not malformed) and send a `GOAWAY` frame.
- The value returned by the builtin `recover()` function has the type `any`, and its underlying type could be `string`, `error`, or something else — whatever the parameter passed to `panic()` was. In our case, it’s the string `"oops! something went wrong"` . In the code above, we normalize this into an `error` by using the `fmt.Errorf()` function to create a new `error` object containing the default textual representation of the `any` value, and then pass this `error` to the `app.serverError()` helper method

```go
// File: cmd/web/routes.go 

package main 

import "net/http" 

func (app *application) routes() http.Handler {  
  mux := http.NewServeMux()  
  
  fileServer := http.FileServer(http.Dir("./ui/static/"))  
  mux.Handle("/static/", http.StripPrefix("/static", fileServer))  
  
  mux.HandleFunc("/", app.home)  
  mux.HandleFunc("/snippet/view", app.snippetView)  
  mux.HandleFunc("/snippet/create", app.snippetCreate)  
  
  // Wrap the existing chain with the recoverPanic middleware.
  return app.recoverPanic(app.logRequest(secureHeaders(mux))) }
```

#### Additional information

##### Panic recovery in other background goroutines

It’s important to realise that our middleware will only recover panics that happen in the same goroutine that executed the `recoverPanic()` middleware.

If, for example, you have a handler which spins up another goroutine (e.g. to do some background processing), then any panics that happen in the second goroutine will not be recovered — not by the `recoverPanic()` middleware… and not by the panic recovery built into Go HTTP server. They will cause your application to exit and bring down the server.

So, if you are spinning up additional goroutines from within your web application and there is any chance of a panic, you must make sure that you recover any panics from within those too. For example:

```go
func myHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {  
  ...
  
  // Spin up a new goroutine to do some background processing.
  go func() {    
    defer func() {   
      if err := recover(); err != nil {        
        log.Print(fmt.Errorf("%s\n%s", err, debug.Stack()))   
      }      
    }()    
    
    doSomeBackgroundProcessing()   
  }()   
  
  w.Write([]byte("OK"))
}
```

### Composable middleware chains

Let’s update our routes.go file to use the [justinas/alice](https://github.com/justinas/alice) package as follows:

```go
// File: cmd/web/routes.go 

package main 

import (  
  "net/http"  
  
  "github.com/justinas/alice" // New import 
) 

func (app *application) routes() http.Handler {  
  mux := http.NewServeMux()   
  
  fileServer := http.FileServer(http.Dir("./ui/static/"))  
  mux.Handle("/static/", http.StripPrefix("/static", fileServer))   
  
  mux.HandleFunc("/", app.home)   
  mux.HandleFunc("/snippet/view", app.snippetView)   
  mux.HandleFunc("/snippet/create", app.snippetCreate)   
  
  // Create a middleware chain containing our 'standard' middleware 
  // which will be used for every request our application receives.
  standard := alice.New(app.recoverPanic, app.logRequest, secureHeaders) 
  
  // Return the 'standard' middleware chain followed by the servemux.
  return standard.Then(mux)
}
```
