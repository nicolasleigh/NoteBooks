### Web application basics

```go
// File: main.go

package main 

import (    
  "log"
  "net/http" 
) 

// Define a home handler function which writes a byte slice containing 
// "Hello from Snippetbox" as the response body.
func home(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {  
  w.Write([]byte("Hello from Snippetbox")) 
}

func main() {   
  // Use the http.NewServeMux() function to initialize a new servemux, then   
  // register the home function as the handler for the "/" URL pattern.
  mux := http.NewServeMux()   
  mux.HandleFunc("/", home)    
  
  // Use the http.ListenAndServe() function to start a new web server. We pass in   
  // two parameters: the TCP network address to listen on (in this case ":4000")   
  // and the servemux we just created. If http.ListenAndServe() returns an error  
  // we use the log.Fatal() function to log the error message and exit. Note  
  // that any error returned by http.ListenAndServe() is always non-nil.
  log.Print("Starting server on :4000")   
  err := http.ListenAndServe(":4000", mux)   
  log.Fatal(err) 
}
```

### Routing requests

```go
// File: main.go 

package main 

import (   
  "log"  
  "net/http" 
) 

func home(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {  
  w.Write([]byte("Hello from Snippetbox")) 
} 

// Add a snippetView handler function.
func snippetView(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {  
  w.Write([]byte("Display a specific snippet...")) 
}

// Add a snippetCreate handler function.
func snippetCreate(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {  
  w.Write([]byte("Create a new snippet..."))
}

func main() {  
  // Register the two new handler functions and corresponding URL patterns with  
  // the servemux, in exactly the same way that we did before.
  mux := http.NewServeMux()   
  mux.HandleFunc("/", home)   
  mux.HandleFunc("/snippet/view", snippetView)   
  mux.HandleFunc("/snippet/create", snippetCreate)  
  log.Print("Starting server on :4000") 
  err := http.ListenAndServe(":4000", mux)   
  log.Fatal(err) 
}
```

#### Fixed path and subtree patterns

Go’s servemux supports two different types of URL patterns: fixed paths and subtree paths. Fixed paths don’t end with a trailing slash, whereas subtree paths do end with a trailing slash.

Our two new patterns — "`/snippet/view`" and "`/snippet/create`" — are both examples of fixed paths. In Go’s servemux, fixed path patterns like these are only matched (and the corresponding handler called) when the request URL path exactly matches the fixed path.

In contrast, our pattern "`/`" is an example of a subtree path (because it ends in a trailing slash). Another example would be something like "`/static/`". Subtree path patterns are matched (and the corresponding handler called) whenever the start of a request URL path matches the subtree path. If it helps your understanding, you can think of subtree paths as acting a bit like they have a wildcard at the end, like "`/**`" or "`/static/**`".

This helps explain why the "`/`" pattern is acting like a catch-all. The pattern essentially means match a single slash, followed by anything (or nothing at all).

#### Restricting the root url pattern

So what if you don’t want the "/" pattern to act like a catch-all? 

For instance, in the application we’re building we want the home page to be displayed if —and only if — the request URL path exactly matches "/". Otherwise, we want the user to receive a 404 page not found response. 

It’s not possible to change the behavior of Go’s servemux to do this, but you can include a simple check in the home hander which ultimately has the same effect:

```go
// File: main.go 

package main 

...

func home(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {    
  // Check if the current request URL path exactly matches "/". If it doesn't, use  
  // the http.NotFound() function to send a 404 response to the client.
  // Importantly, we then return from the handler. If we don't return the handler   
  // would keep executing and also write the "Hello from SnippetBox" message.
  if r.URL.Path != "/" {    
    http.NotFound(w, r)    
    return    
  }    
  
  w.Write([]byte("Hello from Snippetbox")) 
} 

...
```

#### The DefaultServeMux

If you’ve been working with Go for a while you might have come across the http.Handle() and http.HandleFunc() functions. These allow you to register routes without declaring a servemux, like this:

```go
func main() {  
  http.HandleFunc("/", home)  
  http.HandleFunc("/snippet/view", snippetView)   
  http.HandleFunc("/snippet/create", snippetCreate)   
  
  log.Print("Starting server on :4000")  
  err := http.ListenAndServe(":4000", nil)  
  log.Fatal(err) 
}
```

Behind the scenes, these functions register their routes with something called the DefaultServeMux. There’s nothing special about this — it’s just regular servemux like we’ve already been using, but which is initialized by default and stored in a net/http global variable. Here’s the relevant line from the Go source code:

```go
var DefaultServeMux = NewServeMux()
```

Although this approach can make your code slightly shorter, I don’t recommend it for production applications.

Because DefaultServeMux is a global variable, any package can access it and register a route — including any third-party packages that your application imports. If one of those thirdparty packages is compromised, they could use DefaultServeMux to expose a malicious handler to the web.

So, for the sake of security, it’s generally a good idea to avoid DefaultServeMux and the corresponding helper functions. Use your own locally-scoped servemux instead, like we have been doing in this project so far.

#### Additional information

##### Servemux features and quirks

In Go’s servemux, longer URL patterns always take precedence over shorter ones. So, if a servemux contains multiple patterns which match a request, it will always dispatch the request to the handler corresponding to the longest pattern. This has the nice side-effect that you can register patterns in any order and it won’t change how the servemux behaves.

Request URL paths are automatically sanitized. If the request path contains any `.` or `..` elements or repeated slashes, the user will automatically be redirected to an equivalent clean URL. For example, if a user makes a request to `/foo/bar/..//baz` they will automatically be sent a `301 Permanent Redirect` to `/foo/baz` instead.

If a subtree path has been registered and a request is received for that subtree path without a trailing slash, then the user will automatically be sent a `301 Permanent Redirect` to the subtree path with the slash added. For example, if you have registered the subtree path `/foo/`, then any request to `/foo` will be redirected to `/foo/`.

##### Host name matching

It’s possible to include host names in your URL patterns. This can be useful when you want to redirect all HTTP requests to a canonical URL, or if your application is acting as the back end for multiple sites or services. For example:

```go
mux := http.NewServeMux() 
mux.HandleFunc("foo.example.org/", fooHandler) 
mux.HandleFunc("bar.example.org/", barHandler) 
mux.HandleFunc("/baz", bazHandler)
```

##### What about RESTful routing?

It’s important to acknowledge that the routing functionality provided by Go’s servemux is pretty lightweight. It doesn’t support routing based on the request method, it doesn’t support clean URLs with variables in them, and it doesn’t support regexp-based patterns.

But don’t let that put you off. The reality is that Go’s servemux can still get you quite far, and for many applications is perfectly sufficient. For the times that you need more, there’s a huge choice of third-party routers that you can use instead of Go’s servemux. We’ll look at some of the popular options later in the book.

### Customizing HTTP headers

#### HTTP status codes

```go
// File: main.go 

package main 

...

func snippetCreate(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {  
  // Use r.Method to check whether the request is using POST or not.
  if r.Method != "POST" {     
    // If it's not, use the w.WriteHeader() method to send a 405 status     
    // code and the w.Write() method to write a "Method Not Allowed" 
    // response body. We then return from the function so that the    
    // subsequent code is not executed.
    w.WriteHeader(405)     
    w.Write([]byte("Method Not Allowed"))     
    return    
  }   
  
  w.Write([]byte("Create a new snippet...")) 
} 

...
```

It’s only possible to call `w.WriteHeader()` once per response, and after the status code has been written it can’t be changed. If you try to call `w.WriteHeader()` a second time Go will log a warning message.

If you don’t call `w.WriteHeader()` explicitly, then the first call to `w.Write()` will automatically send a `200 OK` status code to the user. So, if you want to send a non-200 status code, you must call `w.WriteHeader()` before any call to `w.Write()`.

#### Customizing headers

Another improvement we can make is to include an `Allow` header with the `405 Method Not Allowed` response to let the user know which request methods are supported for that particular URL.

We can do this by using the `w.Header().Set()` method to add a new header to the response header map, like so:

```go
// File: main.go 

package main 

...

func snippetCreate(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {  
  if r.Method != "POST" {     
    // Use the Header().Set() method to add an 'Allow: POST' header to the      
    // response header map. The first parameter is the header name, and      
    // the second parameter is the header value.
    w.Header().Set("Allow", "POST")     
    w.WriteHeader(405)       
    w.Write([]byte("Method Not Allowed"))   
    return   
  } 
  
  w.Write([]byte("Create a new snippet...")) 
} 

...
```

**Important**: Changing the response header map after a call to `w.WriteHeader()` or `w.Write()` will have no effect on the headers that the user receives. You need to make sure that your response header map contains all the headers you want before you call these methods.

#### The http.Error shortcut

If you want to send a non-200 status code and a plain-text response body (like we are in the code above) then it’s a good opportunity to use the http.Error() shortcut. This is a lightweight helper function which takes a given message and status code, then calls the `w.WriteHeader()` and `w.Write()` methods behind-the-scenes for us.

```go
// File: main.go 

package main 

...

func snippetCreate(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {  
  if r.Method != "POST" {   
    w.Header().Set("Allow", "POST")   
    // Use the http.Error() function to send a 405 status code and "Method Not   
    // Allowed" string as the response body.
    http.Error(w, "Method Not Allowed", 405)    
    return    
  }  
  
  w.Write([]byte("Create a new snippet...")) 
}

...
```

#### The net/http constants

Specifically, we can use the constant `http.MethodPost` instead of the string "`POST`", and the constant `http.StatusMethodNotAllowed` instead of the integer `405`.

```go
// File: main.go 

package main 

...

func snippetCreate(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {  
  if r.Method != http.MethodPost {     
    w.Header().Set("Allow", http.MethodPost)   
    http.Error(w, "Method Not Allowed", http.StatusMethodNotAllowed)    
    return  
  }  
  
  w.Write([]byte("Create a new snippet...")) 
} 

...
```

#### Additional information

##### System-generated headers and content sniffing

When sending a response Go will automatically set three system-generated headers for you: Date and Content-Length and Content-Type.

The Content-Type header is particularly interesting. Go will attempt to set the correct one for you by content sniffing the response body with the `http.DetectContentType()` function. If this function can’t guess the content type, Go will fall back to setting the header `Content-Type: application/octet-stream` instead.

The `http.DetectContentType()` function generally works quite well, but a common gotcha for web developers new to Go is that it can’t distinguish JSON from plain text. So, by default, JSON responses will be sent with a `Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8` header. You can prevent this from happening by setting the correct header manually like so:

```go
w.Header().Set("Content-Type", "application/json") 
w.Write([]byte(`{"name":"Alex"}`))
```

##### Manipulating the header map

In the code above we used w.Header().Set() to add a new header to the response header map. But there’s also `Add()`, `Del()`, `Get()` and `Values()` methods that you can use to read and manipulate the header map too.

```go
// Set a new cache-control header. If an existing "Cache-Control" header exists 
// it will be overwritten.
w.Header().Set("Cache-Control", "public, max-age=31536000") 

// In contrast, the Add() method appends a new "Cache-Control" header and can 
// be called multiple times.
w.Header().Add("Cache-Control", "public") 
w.Header().Add("Cache-Control", "max-age=31536000") 

// Delete all values for the "Cache-Control" header.
w.Header().Del("Cache-Control") 

// Retrieve the first value for the "Cache-Control" header.
w.Header().Get("Cache-Control") 

// Retrieve a slice of all values for the "Cache-Control" header.
w.Header().Values("Cache-Control")
```

##### Header canonicalization

When you’re using the Set(), Add(), Del(), Get() and Values() methods on the header map, the header name will always be canonicalized using the [textproto.CanonicalMIMEHeaderKey()](https://pkg.go.dev/net/textproto#CanonicalMIMEHeaderKey) function.

Note: If a HTTP/2 connection is being used, Go will always automatically convert the header names and values to lowercase for you.

##### Suppressing system-generated headers

The `Del()` method doesn’t remove system-generated headers. To suppress these, you need to access the underlying header map directly and set the value to nil. If you want to suppress the Date header, for example, you need to write:

```go
w.Header()["Date"] = nil
```

### URL query strings

For URL `/snippet/view?id=1`, we need to retrieve the value of the id parameter from the URL query string, which we can do using the `r.URL.Query().Get()` method. This will always return a string value for a parameter, or the empty string "" if no matching parameter exists.

Because the id parameter is untrusted user input, we should validate it to make sure it’s sane and sensible. For the purpose of our Snippetbox application, we want to check that it contains a positive integer value. We can do this by trying to convert the string value to an integer with the `strconv.Atoi()` function, and then checking the value is greater than zero.

```go
// File: main.go 

package main 

import (    
  "fmt" // New import 
  "log"   
  "net/http"  
  "strconv" // New import
)

...

func snippetView(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {  
  // Extract the value of the id parameter from the query string and try to 
  // convert it to an integer using the strconv.Atoi() function. If it can't  
  // be converted to an integer, or the value is less than 1, we return a 404 page 
  // not found response.
  id, err := strconv.Atoi(r.URL.Query().Get("id"))  
  if err != nil || id < 1 {   
    http.NotFound(w, r)    
    return   
  }   
  
  // Use the fmt.Fprintf() function to interpolate the id value with our response    
  // and write it to the http.ResponseWriter.
  fmt.Fprintf(w, "Display a specific snippet with ID %d...", id) 
}

...
```

### Project structure and organization

#### Refactoring your existing code

```go
// File: cmd/web/main.go 

package main 

import (  
  "log"  
  "net/http" 
) 

func main() {   
  mux := http.NewServeMux()   
  mux.HandleFunc("/", home)  
  mux.HandleFunc("/snippet/view", snippetView)   
  mux.HandleFunc("/snippet/create", snippetCreate)   
  log.Print("Starting server on :4000")   
  err := http.ListenAndServe(":4000", mux)  
  log.Fatal(err) 
}
```

```go
// File: cmd/web/handlers.go 

package main

import (   
  "fmt"  
  "net/http" 
  "strconv" 
) 

func home(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) { 
  if r.URL.Path != "/" {    
    http.NotFound(w, r)    
    return   
  }   
  
  w.Write([]byte("Hello from Snippetbox")) 
} 

func snippetView(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {  
  id, err := strconv.Atoi(r.URL.Query().Get("id"))  
  if err != nil || id < 1 {    
    http.NotFound(w, r)   
    return    
  }   
  
  fmt.Fprintf(w, "Display a specific snippet with ID %d...", id) 
} 

func snippetCreate(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {  
  if r.Method != http.MethodPost {     
    w.Header().Set("Allow", http.MethodPost)   
    http.Error(w, "Method Not Allowed", http.StatusMethodNotAllowed)  
    return   
  }   
  
  w.Write([]byte("Create a new snippet...")) 
}
```

#### Additional information

##### The internal directory

It’s important to point out that the directory name internal carries a special meaning and behavior in Go: any packages which live under this directory can only be imported by code inside the parent of the internal directory. In our case, this means that any packages which live in internal can only be imported by code inside our snippetbox project directory.

Or, looking at it the other way, this means that any packages under internal cannot be imported by code outside of our project.

This is useful because it prevents other codebases from importing and relying on the (potentially unversioned and unsupported) packages in our internal directory — even if the project code is publicly available somewhere like GitHub.

### HTML templating and inheritance

```html
// File: ui/html/pages/home.tmpl

<!doctype html> 
<html lang='en'>  
  <head>     
    <meta charset='utf-8'>   
    <title>Home - Snippetbox</title>   
  </head>    
  <body>     
    <header>      
      <h1><a href='/'>Snippetbox</a></h1>    
    </header>    
    <main>        
      <h2>Latest Snippets</h2>     
      <p>There's nothing to see here yet!</p>    
    </main>     
    <footer>Powered by <a href='https://golang.org/'>Go</a></footer> 
  </body> 
</html>
```

```go
// File: cmd/web/handlers.go 

package main 

import (  
  "fmt"  
  "html/template" // New import  
  "log"           // New import  
  "net/http"  
  "strconv" 
) 

func home(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {  
  if r.URL.Path != "/" {    
    http.NotFound(w, r)    
    return   
  }   
  
  // Use the template.ParseFiles() function to read the template file into a  
  // template set. If there's an error, we log the detailed error message and use  
  // the http.Error() function to send a generic 500 Internal Server Error  
  // response to the user.
  ts, err := template.ParseFiles("./ui/html/pages/home.tmpl") 
  if err != nil {      
    log.Print(err.Error())    
    http.Error(w, "Internal Server Error", 500)   
    return   
  }    
  
  // We then use the Execute() method on the template set to write the  
  // template content as the response body. The last parameter to Execute()  
  // represents any dynamic data that we want to pass in, which for now we'll 
  // leave as nil.
  err = ts.Execute(w, nil)    
  if err != nil {     
    log.Print(err.Error())    
    http.Error(w, "Internal Server Error", 500)   
  }
}

...
```

#### Template composition

To save us typing and prevent duplication, it’s a good idea to create a base (or master) template which contains shared content, which we can then compose with the pagespecific markup for the individual pages.

```html
// File: ui/html/base.tmpl 

{{define "base"}}
<!doctype html> 
<html lang='en'>  
  <head>      
    <meta charset='utf-8'>   
    <title>{{template "title" .}} - Snippetbox</title>  
  </head>    
  <body>  
    <header>   
      <h1><a href='/'>Snippetbox</a></h1>  
    </header>    
    <main>     
      {{template "main" .}}     
    </main>     
    <footer>Powered by <a href='https://golang.org/'>Go</a></footer>   
  </body> 
</html> 
{{end}}
```

Here we’re using the `{{define "base"}}...{{end}}` action to define a distinct named template called `base`, which contains the content we want to appear on every page.

Inside this we use the `{{template "title" .}}` and `{{template "main" .}}` actions to denote that we want to invoke other named templates (called `title` and `main`) at a particular point in the HTML

Note: If you’re wondering, the dot at the end of the `{{template "title" .}}` action represents any dynamic data that you want to pass to the invoked template.

```html
// File: ui/html/pages/home.tmpl 

{{define "title"}}Home{{end}} 

{{define "main"}}  
<h2>Latest Snippets</h2>   
<p>There's nothing to see here yet!</p> 
{{end}}
```

```go
// File: cmd/web/handlers.go 

package main 

...

func home(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {  
  if r.URL.Path != "/" {  
    http.NotFound(w, r) 
    return    
  }   
  
  // Initialize a slice containing the paths to the two files. It's important  
  // to note that the file containing our base template must be the *first*  
  // file in the slice.
  files := []string{ 
    "./ui/html/base.tmpl",    
    "./ui/html/pages/home.tmpl",  
  }    
  
  // Use the template.ParseFiles() function to read the files and store the   
  // templates in a template set. Notice that we can pass the slice of file 
  // paths as a variadic parameter.
  ts, err := template.ParseFiles(files...)   
  if err != nil {   
    log.Print(err.Error())   
    http.Error(w, "Internal Server Error", 500) 
    return   
  }   
  
  // Use the ExecuteTemplate() method to write the content of the "base"  
  // template as the response body.
  err = ts.ExecuteTemplate(w, "base", nil)  
  if err != nil {     
    log.Print(err.Error())    
    http.Error(w, "Internal Server Error", 500) 
  }
}

...
```

#### Embedding partials

```html
// File: ui/html/partials/nav.tmpl

{{define "nav"}} 
<nav>  
  <a href='/'>Home</a> 
</nav> 
{{end}}
```

```html
// File: ui/html/base.tmpl 

{{define "base"}}

    <header>     
      <h1><a href='/'>Snippetbox</a></h1>  
    </header>    
    <!-- Invoke the navigation template -->    
    {{template "nav" .}}    
    <main>    
      {{template "main" .}}     
    </main>   
    <footer>Powered by <a href='https://golang.org/'>Go</a></footer>  
  </body> 
</html> 
{{end}}
```

```go
// File: cmd/web/handlers.go 

package main 

...

func home(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {  
  if r.URL.Path != "/" {    
    http.NotFound(w, r)  
    return   
  }    
  
  // Include the navigation partial in the template files.
  files := []string{     
    "./ui/html/base.tmpl",    
    "./ui/html/partials/nav.tmpl",    
    "./ui/html/pages/home.tmpl",   
  }   
  
  ts, err := template.ParseFiles(files...)  
  if err != nil {    
    log.Print(err.Error())     
    http.Error(w, "Internal Server Error", 500)   
    return   
  }   
  
  err = ts.ExecuteTemplate(w, "base", nil)   
  if err != nil {     
    log.Print(err.Error())    
    http.Error(w, "Internal Server Error", 500) 
  }
}

...
```

### Serving static files

#### The http.Fileserver handler

```go
// File: cmd/web/main.go 

package main 

import (   
  "log" 
  "net/http" 
) 

func main() {  
  mux := http.NewServeMux()    
  
  // Create a file server which serves files out of the "./ui/static" directory.
  // Note that the path given to the http.Dir function is relative to the project  
  // directory root.
  fileServer := http.FileServer(http.Dir("./ui/static/")) 
  
  // Use the mux.Handle() function to register the file server as the handler for 
  // all URL paths that start with "/static/". For matching paths, we strip the  
  // "/static" prefix before the request reaches the file server.
  mux.Handle("/static/", http.StripPrefix("/static", fileServer))   
  
  // Register the other application routes as normal.
  mux.HandleFunc("/", home)   
  mux.HandleFunc("/snippet/view", snippetView)   
  mux.HandleFunc("/snippet/create", snippetCreate) 
  
  log.Print("Starting server on :4000")   
  err := http.ListenAndServe(":4000", mux)  
  log.Fatal(err) 
}
```

#### Using the static files

#### Additional information

##### Features and functions

Go’s file server has a few really nice features that are worth mentioning:

- It sanitizes all request paths by running them through the `path.Clean()` function before searching for a file. This removes any . and .. elements from the URL path, which helps to stop directory traversal attacks. This feature is particularly useful if you’re using the fileserver in conjunction with a router that doesn’t automatically sanitize URL paths.
- Range requests are fully supported. This is great if your application is serving large files and you want to support resumable downloads.
- The `Last-Modified` and `If-Modified-Since` headers are transparently supported. If a file hasn’t changed since the user last requested it, then `http.FileServer` will send a `304 Not Modified` status code instead of the file itself. This helps reduce latency and processing overhead for both the client and server.
- The `Content-Type` is automatically set from the file extension using the `mime.TypeByExtension()` function. You can add your own custom extensions and content types using the `mime.AddExtensionType()` function if necessary.

##### Performance

It’s important to note that, once the application is up-and-running, `http.FileServer` probably won’t be reading these files from disk. Both Windows and Unix-based operating systems cache recently-used files in RAM, so (for frequently-served files at least) it’s likely that `http.FileServer` will be serving them from RAM rather than making the relatively slow round-trip to your hard disk.

##### Serving single files

Sometimes you might want to serve a single file from within a handler. For this there’s the `http.ServeFile()` function, which you can use like so:

```go
func downloadHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) { 
  http.ServeFile(w, r, "./ui/static/file.zip") 
}
```

**Warning**: `http.ServeFile()` does not automatically sanitize the file path. If you’re constructing a file path from untrusted user input, to avoid directory traversal attacks you must sanitize the input with `filepath.Clean()` before using it.

##### Disabling directory listings

If you want to disable directory listings there are a few different approaches you can take.

The simplest way: Add a blank `index.html` file to the specific directory that you want to disable listings for. This will then be served instead of the directory listing, and the user will get a `200 OK` response with no body. If you want to do this for all directories under `./ui/static` you can use the command:

```bash
$ find ./ui/static -type d -exec touch {}/index.html \;
```

> **`find ./ui/static`**:
>
> * `find` is a command used to search for files and directories in a directory hierarchy.
> * `./ui/static` is the starting directory for the search. It means "start looking from the `ui/static` directory in the current directory."
>
> **`-type d`**:
>
> * This option tells `find` to look for directories only (`-type d` stands for "directory"). It will exclude regular files, symbolic links, and other types of files.
>
> **`-exec touch {}/index.html \;`**:
>
> * The `-exec` option allows you to run a command on each file or directory that `find` locates. In this case, the command to run is `touch {}/index.html`.
> * `{}` is a placeholder that represents the current directory found by `find`. For each directory found, `{}` is replaced with that directory's path.
> * `touch` is a command that creates an empty file (if it doesn't already exist) or updates the timestamp of an existing file. In this case, it creates or updates a file named `index.html` inside each directory found.
> * `\;` marks the end of the `-exec` command. The backslash before the semicolon is necessary to escape it, because semicolons have special meaning in the shell (to separate commands).

A more complicated (but arguably better) solution is to create a custom implementation of `http.FileSystem`, and have it return an `os.ErrNotExist` error for any directories. A full explanation and sample code can be found in this blog post: [How to Disable FileServer Directory Listings](https://www.alexedwards.net/blog/disable-http-fileserver-directory-listings).

### The http.Handler interface

Strictly speaking, what we mean by handler is an object which satisfies the `http.Handler` interface:

```go
type Handler interface {  
  ServeHTTP(ResponseWriter, *Request) 
}
```

In simple terms, this basically means that to be a handler an object must have a `ServeHTTP()` method with the exact signature:

```go
ServeHTTP(http.ResponseWriter, *http.Request)
```

So in its simplest form a handler might look something like this:

```go
type home struct {} 

func (h *home) ServeHTTP(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {  
  w.Write([]byte("This is my home page")) 
}
```

Here we have an object (in this case it’s a home struct, but it could equally be a string or function or anything else), and we’ve implemented a method with the signature `ServeHTTP(http.ResponseWriter, *http.Request)` on it. That’s all we need to make a handler.

You could then register this with a servemux using the `Handle` method like so:

```go
mux := http.NewServeMux() 
mux.Handle("/", &home{})
```

When this servemux receives a HTTP request for "`/`", it will then call the `ServeHTTP()` method of the home struct — which in turn writes the HTTP response.

#### Handler functions

Now, creating an object just so we can implement a ServeHTTP() method on it is long-winded and a bit confusing. Which is why in practice it’s far more common to write your handlers as a normal function (like we have been so far). For example:

```go
func home(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {   
  w.Write([]byte("This is my home page"))
}
```

But this home function is just a normal function; it doesn’t have a `ServeHTTP()` method. So in itself it isn’t a handler.

Instead we can transform it into a handler using the `http.HandlerFunc()` adapter, like so:

```go
mux := http.NewServeMux() 
mux.Handle("/", http.HandlerFunc(home))
```

The `http.HandlerFunc()` adapter works by automatically adding a `ServeHTTP()` method to the home function. When executed, this `ServeHTTP()` method then simply calls the content of the original home function. It’s a roundabout but convenient way of coercing a normal function into satisfying the `http.Handler` interface.

Throughout this project so far we’ve been using the `HandleFunc()` method to register our handler functions with the servemux. This is just some syntactic sugar that transforms a function to a handler and registers it in one step, instead of having to do it manually. The code above is functionality equivalent to this:

```go
mux := http.NewServeMux() 
mux.HandleFunc("/", home)
```

#### Chaining handlers

The eagle-eyed of you might have noticed something interesting right at the start of this project. The `http.ListenAndServe()` function takes a `http.Handler` object as the second parameter…

```go
func ListenAndServe(addr string, handler Handler) error
```

… but we’ve been passing in a servemux.

We were able to do this because the servemux also has a `ServeHTTP()` method, meaning that it too satisfies the `http.Handler` interface.

In fact, what exactly is happening is this: When our server receives a new HTTP request, it calls the servemux’s `ServeHTTP()` method. This looks up the relevant handler based on the request URL path, and in turn calls that handler’s `ServeHTTP()` method. You can think of a Go web application as a chain of `ServeHTTP()` methods being called one after another.

#### Requests are handled concurrently

There is one more thing that’s really important to point out: all incoming HTTP requests are served in their own goroutine. For busy servers, this means it’s very likely that the code in or called by your handlers will be running concurrently. While this helps make Go blazingly fast, the downside is that you need to be aware of (and protect against) **race conditions** when accessing shared resources from your handlers, check out this blog post: [Understanding Mutexes](https://www.alexedwards.net/blog/understanding-mutexes)
