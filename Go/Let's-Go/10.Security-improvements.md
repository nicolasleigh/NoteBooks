### Generating a self-signed TLS certificate

HTTPS is essentially HTTP sent across a TLS (Transport Layer Security) connection. Because it’s sent over a TLS connection the data is encrypted and signed, which helps ensure its privacy and integrity during transit.

If you’re not familiar with the term, TLS is essentially the modern version of SSL (Secure Sockets Layer). SSL now has been officially deprecated due to security concerns, but the name still lives on in the public consciousness and is often used interoperably with TLS. For clarity and accuracy, we’ll stick with the term TLS throughout this book.

For production servers I recommend using [Let’s Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) to create your TLS certificates, but for development purposes the simplest thing to do is to generate your own self-signed certificate.

Handily, the `crypto/tls` package in Go’s standard library includes a `generate_cert.go` tool that we can use to easily create our own self-signed certificate.

To run the generate_cert.go tool, you’ll need to know the place on your computer where the source code for the Go standard library is installed. If you’re using Linux, macOS or FreeBSD and followed the official install instructions, then the `generate_cert.go` file should be located under `/usr/local/go/src/crypto/tls`.

### Running a HTTPS server

```go
// File: cmd/web/main.go

package main 

...

func main() {  
  addr := flag.String("addr", ":4000", "HTTP network address")  
  dsn := flag.String("dsn", "web:pass@/snippetbox?parseTime=true", "MySQL data source name")
  
  flag.Parse()    
  
  infoLog := log.New(os.Stdout, "INFO\t", log.Ldate|log.Ltime)   
  errorLog := log.New(os.Stderr, "ERROR\t", log.Ldate|log.Ltime|log.Lshortfile)  
  
  db, err := openDB(*dsn)  
  if err != nil {   
    errorLog.Fatal(err)  
  }   
  
  defer db.Close()   
  
  templateCache, err := newTemplateCache()  
  if err != nil {     
    errorLog.Fatal(err)   
  }   
  
  formDecoder := form.NewDecoder()  
  sessionManager := scs.New()   
  sessionManager.Store = mysqlstore.New(db)  
  sessionManager.Lifetime = 12 * time.Hour 
  
  // Make sure that the Secure attribute is set on our session cookies.
  // Setting this means that the cookie will only be sent by a user's web  
  // browser when a HTTPS connection is being used (and won't be sent over an 
  // unsecure HTTP connection).
  sessionManager.Cookie.Secure = true   
  
  app := &application{      
    errorLog:       errorLog,     
    infoLog:        infoLog,   
    snippets:       &models.SnippetModel{DB: db},  
    templateCache:  templateCache,      
    formDecoder:    formDecoder,     
    sessionManager: sessionManager,   
  }   
  
  srv := &http.Server{   
    Addr:     *addr,     
    ErrorLog: errorLog,     
    Handler:  app.routes(),   
  }    
  
  infoLog.Printf("Starting server on %s", *addr)    
  
  // Use the ListenAndServeTLS() method to start the HTTPS server. We  
  // pass in the paths to the TLS certificate and corresponding private key as  
  // the two parameters.
  err = srv.ListenAndServeTLS("./tls/cert.pem", "./tls/key.pem")   
  errorLog.Fatal(err) 
}

...
```

### Configuring HTTPS settings

One change, which is almost always a good idea to make, is to restrict the elliptic curves that can potentially be used during the TLS handshake. Go supports a few elliptic curves, but as of Go 1.20 only tls.CurveP256 and tls.X25519 have assembly implementations. The others are very CPU intensive, so omitting them helps ensure that our server will remain performant under heavy loads.

```go
// File: cmd/web/main.go 

package main 

import (  
  "crypto/tls" // New import  
  "database/sql"    
  "flag"    
  "html/template"  
  "log"   
  "net/http"   
  "os"   
  "time"  
  
  "snippetbox.alexedwards.net/internal/models"  
  
  "github.com/alexedwards/scs/mysqlstore"   
  "github.com/alexedwards/scs/v2"   
  "github.com/go-playground/form/v4"   
  _ "github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql" 
)

...

func main() {   
  ...
  
  app := &application{  
    errorLog:       errorLog,    
    infoLog:        infoLog,  
    snippets:       &models.SnippetModel{DB: db},  
    templateCache:  templateCache,      
    formDecoder:    formDecoder,      
    sessionManager: sessionManager,  
  }    
  
  // Initialize a tls.Config struct to hold the non-default TLS settings we   
  // want the server to use. In this case the only thing that we're changing 
  // is the curve preferences value, so that only elliptic curves with   
  // assembly implementations are used.
  tlsConfig := &tls.Config{  
    CurvePreferences: []tls.CurveID{tls.X25519, tls.CurveP256}, 
  }
  
  // Set the server's TLSConfig field to use the tlsConfig variable we just    
  // created.
  srv := &http.Server{   
    Addr:      *addr,   
    ErrorLog:  errorLog,      
    Handler:   app.routes(),    
    TLSConfig: tlsConfig,   
  }   
  
  infoLog.Printf("Starting server on %s", *addr)    
  
  err = srv.ListenAndServeTLS("./tls/cert.pem", "./tls/key.pem")   
  errorLog.Fatal(err) 
}

...
```

### Connection timeouts

```go
// File: cmd/web/main.go

package main 

...

func main() {  
  ...
       
  tlsConfig := &tls.Config{     
    CurvePreferences: []tls.CurveID{tls.X25519, tls.CurveP256},  
  }    
  
  srv := &http.Server{   
    Addr:      *addr,     
    ErrorLog:  errorLog,   
    Handler:   app.routes(),     
    TLSConfig: tlsConfig,      
    // Add Idle, Read and Write timeouts to the server.
    IdleTimeout:  time.Minute,   
    ReadTimeout:  5 * time.Second,     
    WriteTimeout: 10 * time.Second,   
  }
  
  infoLog.Printf("Starting server on %s", *addr)   
  err = srv.ListenAndServeTLS("./tls/cert.pem", "./tls/key.pem")   
  errorLog.Fatal(err) 
}

...
```

#### The IdleTimeout setting

By default, Go enables keep-alives on all accepted connections. This helps reduce latency (especially for HTTPS connections) because a client can reuse the same connection for multiple requests without having to repeat the handshake.

By default, keep-alive connections will be automatically closed after a couple of minutes (with the exact time depending on your operating system). This helps to clear-up connections where the user has unexpectedly disappeared — e.g. due to a power cut client-side.

There is no way to increase this default (unless you roll your own net.Listener), but you can reduce it via the IdleTimeout setting. In our case, we’ve set IdleTimeout to 1 minute, which means that all keep-alive connections will be automatically closed after 1 minute of inactivity.

#### The ReadTimeout setting

In our code we’ve also set the ReadTimeout setting to 5 seconds. This means that if the request headers or body are still being read 5 seconds after the request is first accepted, then Go will close the underlying connection. Because this is a ‘hard’ closure on the connection, the user won’t receive any HTTP(S) response.

Setting a short ReadTimeout period helps to mitigate the risk from slow-client attacks — such as Slowloris — which could otherwise keep a connection open indefinitely by sending partial, incomplete, HTTP(S) requests.

**Important**: If you set ReadTimeout but don’t set IdleTimeout, then IdleTimeout will default to using the same setting as ReadTimeout. For instance, if you set ReadTimeout to 3 seconds, then there is the side-effect that all keep-alive connections will also be closed after 3 seconds of inactivity. Generally, my recommendation is to avoid any ambiguity and always set an explicit IdleTimeout value for your server.

#### The WriteTimeout setting

The WriteTimeout setting will close the underlying connection if our server attempts to write to the connection after a given period (in our code, 10 seconds). But this behaves slightly differently depending on the protocol being used. 

- For HTTP connections, if some data is written to the connection more than 10 seconds after the read of the request header finished, Go will close the underlying connection instead of writing the data. 
- For HTTPS connections, if some data is written to the connection more than 10 seconds after the request is first accepted, Go will close the underlying connection instead of writing the data. This means that if you’re using HTTPS (like we are) it’s sensible to set WriteTimeout to a value greater than ReadTimeout.

It’s important to bear in mind that writes made by a handler are buffered and written to the connection as one when the handler returns. Therefore, the idea of WriteTimeout is generally not to prevent long-running handlers, but to prevent the data that the handler returns from taking too long to write.
