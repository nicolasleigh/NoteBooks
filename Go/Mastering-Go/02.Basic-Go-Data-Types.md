Go provides a special data type, named `error`, for representing error conditions and error messages—in practice, this means that Go treats errors as values. To program successfully in Go, you should be aware of the error conditions that might occur with the functions and methods you are using and handle them accordingly.

You will most likely work with errors in your programs without needing the functionality of the `errors` package. Additionally, you are not going to need to define custom error messages unless you are creating big applications or packages.

If you want to format your error messages in the way `fmt.Printf()` works, you can use the `fmt.Errorf()` function, which simplifies the creation of custom error messages—the `fmt.Errorf()` function returns an error value just like `errors.New()`.

Now, we should talk about something important: you should have a global error-handling tactic in each application that should not change. In practice, this means the following: 

- All error messages should be handled at the same level, which means that all errors should either be returned to the calling function or be handled at the place they occurred.
- The handling of critical errors should be clearly documented. This means that there will be situations where a critical error should terminate the program and other times where a critical error might just create a warning message onscreen and continue.
- It is considered a good practice to send all error messages to the log service of your machine because this way the error messages can be examined later. However, this is not always true, so exercise caution when setting this up—for example, cloud-native apps do not work that way. For cloud-native apps it is better to send the error output to standard error so that the error messages do not get lost.

The `int` and `uint` data types are special as they are the most efficient sizes for signed and unsigned integers on a given platform and can be either 32 or 64 bits each — their size is defined by Go itself based on the CPU register size.

You can create a new byte slice from a given string by using a `[]byte("A String")` statement. Given a byte slice variable b, you can convert it into a string using the `string(b)` statement. When working with byte slices that contain Unicode characters, the number of bytes in a byte slice is not always connected to the number of characters in the byte slice, because most Unicode characters require more than one byte for their representation. As a result, when you try to print each single byte of a byte slice using `fmt.Println()` or `fmt.Print()`, the output is not text presented as characters but instead integer values. If you want to print the contents of a byte slice as text, you should either print it using `string(byteSliceVar)` or using `fmt.Printf()` with `%s` to tell `fmt.Printf()` that you want to print a string. You can initialize a new byte slice with the desired string by using a statement such as `[]byte("My Initialization String")`.

You can define a rune using single quotes: `r := '€'` and you can print the integer value of the bytes that compose it as `fmt.Println(r)`—in this case, the integer value is 8364. Printing it as a single Unicode character requires the use of the `%c` control string in `fmt.Printf()`.

As strings can be accessed as arrays, you can iterate over the runes of the string using a for loop or point to a specific character if you know its place in the string. The length of the string is the same as the number of characters found in the string, which is usually not true for byte slices because Unicode characters usually require more than one byte.

```go

package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	aString := "Hello World! €"
	fmt.Println("First byte", string(aString[0]))

	// Runes
	// A rune
	r := '€'
	fmt.Println("As an int32 value:", r)
	// Convert Runes to text
	fmt.Printf("As a string: %s and as a character: %c\n", r, r)

	// Print an existing string as runes
	for _, v := range aString {
		fmt.Printf("%x ", v)
	}
	fmt.Println()

	// String to rune Array
	myRune := []rune(aString)
	fmt.Printf("myRune %U\n", myRune)

	// Rune array to string
	runeArray := []rune{'1', '2', '3'}
	s := string(runeArray)
	fmt.Println(s)

	// Print an existing string as characters
	for _, v := range aString {
		fmt.Printf("%c", v)
	}
	fmt.Println()
}

/*
First byte H
As an int32 value: 8364
As a string: %!s(int32=8364) and as a character: €
48 65 6c 6c 6f 20 57 6f 72 6c 64 21 20 20ac 
myRune [U+0048 U+0065 U+006C U+006C U+006F U+0020 U+0057 U+006F U+0072 U+006C U+0064 U+0021 U+0020 U+20AC]
123
Hello World! €
*/
```

You can convert an integer value into a string in two main ways: using `string()` and using a function from the `strconv` package. However, the two methods are fundamentally different. The `string()` function converts an integer value into a Unicode code point, which is a single character, whereas functions such as `strconv.FormatInt()` and `strconv.Itoa()` convert an integer value into a string value with the same representation and the same number of characters.

```go

package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"os"
	"strconv"
)

func main() {
	if len(os.Args) == 1 {
		fmt.Println("Print provide an integer.")
		return
	}

	n, err := strconv.Atoi(os.Args[1])
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println(err)
		return
	}

	// Using strconv.Itoa()
	input := strconv.Itoa(n)
	fmt.Printf("strconv.Itoa() %s of type %T\n", input, input)

	// Using strconv.FormatInt
	input = strconv.FormatInt(int64(n), 10)
	fmt.Printf("strconv.FormatInt() %s of type %T\n", input, input)

	// Using string()
	input = string(n)
	fmt.Printf("string() %s of type %T\n", input, input)
}

/*
go run main.go 97   

strconv.Itoa() 97 of type string
strconv.FormatInt() 97 of type string
string() a of type string
*/
```

### The strings package

```go

package main

import (
	"fmt"
	s "strings"
	"unicode"
)

var f = fmt.Printf

func main() {
	f("To Upper: %s\n", s.ToUpper("Hello there!"))

	trimFunction := func(c rune) bool {
		return !unicode.IsLetter(c)
	}
	f("TrimFunc: %s\n", s.TrimFunc("123 abc    ABC.", trimFunction))

### Times and dates

![image-20240915131010335](./image-20240915131010335.png)

The presented utility accepts a date and a time and converts them into different time zones. This can be particularly handy when you want to preprocess log files from different sources that use different time zones to convert these different time zones into a common one. Once again, you need `time.Parse()` in order to convert a valid input into a `time.Time` value before doing the conversions. This time the input string contains the time zone and is parsed by the `"02 January 2006 15:04 MST"` string.

### Constants

Strictly speaking, the value of a constant variable is defined at compile time, not at runtime—this means that it is included in the binary executable. The constant generator `iota` is used for declaring a sequence of related values that use incrementing numbers without the need to explicitly type each one of them.

```go

package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

type Digit int
type Power2 int

func main() {
	const (
		Zero Digit = iota
		One
		Two
		Three
		Four
	)

	fmt.Println(One)
	fmt.Println(Two)

	const (
		p2_0 Power2 = 1 << iota
		_
		p2_2
		_
		p2_4
		_
		p2_6
	)

	fmt.Println("2^0:", p2_0)
	fmt.Println("2^2:", p2_2)
	fmt.Println("2^4:", p2_4)
	fmt.Println("2^6:", p2_6)
}

/*
1
2
2^0: 1
2^2: 4
2^4: 16
2^6: 64
*/
```

Constant values can have a data type. This can be restrictive because a constant value with a data type can only operate with values and variables of the same data type, but it can save you from bugs because the compiler can catch such situations.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

const (
	typedConstant   = int16(100)
	untypedConstant = 100
)

func main() {
	i := 1
	fmt.Println("unTyped:", i*untypedConstant)
	fmt.Println("Typed:", i*typedConstant) // invalid operation: i * typedConstant (mismatched types int and int16)
}

```

### Arrays

When you pass an array to a function, Go creates a copy of that array and passes that copy to that function—therefore any changes you make to an array inside a function are lost when the function exits.

### Slices

Strictly speaking, all parameters in Go are passed by value—there is no other way to pass parameters in Go. However, you can explicitly pass a pointer to a variable in order to pass by reference. A slice value is a header that contains a pointer to an underlying array where the elements are actually stored, the length of the array, and its capacity. Note that the slice value does not include its elements, just a pointer to the underlying array. So, when you pass a slice to a function, Go makes a copy of that header and passes it to the function. This copy of the slice header includes the pointer to the underlying array. That slice header is defined in the reflect package (https://pkg.go.dev/reflect#SliceHeader) as follows:

```go
type SliceHeader struct {     
  Data uintptr     
  Len  int     
  Cap  int 
}
```

A side effect of passing the slice header is that it is faster to pass a slice to a function because Go does not need to make a copy of the slice and its elements, just a copy of the slice header.

You can create a slice using `make()` or like an array without specifying its size or using [...]. If you do not want to initialize a slice, then using `make()` is better and faster. However, if you want to initialize it at the time of creation, then `make()` cannot help you. As a result, you can create a slice with three float64 elements as `aSlice := []float64{1.2, 3.2, -4.5}`. Creating a slice with space for three float64 elements with `make()` is as simple as executing `make([]float64, 3)`. Each element of that slice has a value of 0, which is the zero value of the float64 data type.

Both slices and arrays can have many dimensions—creating a slice with two dimensions with `make()` is as simple as writing `make([][]int, 2)`. This returns a slice with two dimensions where the first dimension is 2 (rows) and the second dimension (columns) is unspecified and should be explicitly specified when adding data to it. If you want to define and initialize a slice with two dimensions at the same time, you should execute something similar to `twoD := [][]int{{1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6}}`.

You can find the length of an array or a slice using `len()`. You can add new elements to a full slice using the `append()` function. `append()` automatically allocates the required memory space. Keep in mind that you should assign the return value of `append()` back to the desired variable as this is not an in-place change. The capacity shows how much a slice can be expanded without the need to allocate more memory and change the underlying array.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	// Create an empty slice
	aSlice := []float64{}
	// Both length and capacity are 0 because aSlice is empty
	fmt.Println(aSlice, len(aSlice), cap(aSlice))

	// Add elements to a slice
	aSlice = append(aSlice, 1234.56)
	aSlice = append(aSlice, -34.0)
	fmt.Println(aSlice, "with length and capacity", len(aSlice), cap(aSlice))

	// A slice with a length of 4
	t := make([]int, 4)
	t[0] = -1
	t[1] = -2
	t[2] = -3
	t[3] = -4
	// t[4] = 999 // runtime error: index out of range [4] with length 4
	// Now you will need to use append
	t = append(t, -5)
	fmt.Println(t)

	// A 2D slice
	// You can have as many dimensions as needed
	twoD := [][]int{{1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6}}

	// Visiting all elements of a 2D slice with a double for loop
	for _, i := range twoD {
		for _, k := range i {
			fmt.Print(k, " ")
		}
		fmt.Println()
	}

	make2D := make([][]int, 2)
	fmt.Println(make2D)
	make2D[0] = []int{1, 2, 3, 4}
	make2D[1] = []int{-1, -2, -3, -4}
	fmt.Println(make2D)
}

/*
[] 0 0
[1234.56 -34] with length and capacity 2 2
[-1 -2 -3 -4 -5]
1 2 3 
4 5 6 
[[] []]
[[1 2 3 4] [-1 -2 -3 -4]]
*/

```

### About slice length and capacity

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	// Only length is defined. Capacity = length
	a := make([]int, 4)
	fmt.Println("L:", len(a), "C:", cap(a))
	// Initialize slice. Capacity = length
	b := []int{0, 1, 2, 3, 4}
	fmt.Println("L:", len(b), "C:", cap(b))
	// Same length and capacity
	aSlice := make([]int, 4, 4)
	fmt.Println(aSlice)
	// Add an element
	aSlice = append(aSlice, 5)
	fmt.Println(aSlice)
	// The capacity is doubled
	fmt.Println("L:", len(aSlice), "C:", cap(aSlice))
	// Now add four elements
	aSlice = append(aSlice, []int{-1, -2, -3, -4}...)
	fmt.Println(aSlice)
	// The capacity is doubled
	fmt.Println("L:", len(aSlice), "C:", cap(aSlice))
}

/*
L: 4 C: 4
L: 5 C: 5
[0 0 0 0]
[0 0 0 0 5]
L: 5 C: 8
[0 0 0 0 5 -1 -2 -3 -4]
L: 9 C: 16
*/
```

### Selecting a part of a slice

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	aSlice := []int{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
	fmt.Println(aSlice)
	l := len(aSlice)

	// First 5 elements
	fmt.Println(aSlice[0:5])
	// First 5 elements
	fmt.Println(aSlice[:5])

	// Last 2 elements
	fmt.Println(aSlice[l-2 : l])

	// Last 2 elements
	fmt.Println(aSlice[l-2:])

	// First 5 elements
	t := aSlice[0:5:10]
	fmt.Println(len(t), cap(t))

	// Elements at indexes 2,3,4
	// Capacity will be 10-2
	t = aSlice[2:5:10]
	fmt.Println(len(t), cap(t))

	// Elements at indexes 0,1,2,3,4
	// New capacity will be 6-0
	t = aSlice[:5:6]
	fmt.Println(len(t), cap(t))
}

/*
[0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9]
[0 1 2 3 4]
[0 1 2 3 4]
[8 9]
[8 9]
5 10
3 8
5 6
*/
```

### Byte slices

Go uses byte slices for performing file I/O operations because they allow you to determine with precision the amount of data you want to read or write to a file. This happens because bytes are a universal unit among computer systems.

As Go does not have a data type for storing single characters, it uses byte and rune for storing character values. A single byte can store a single ASCII character only whereas a rune can store Unicode characters. As a result, a rune can occupy multiple bytes.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	// Byte slice
	b := make([]byte, 12)
	fmt.Println("Byte slice:", b)
	b = []byte("Byte slice €")
	fmt.Println("Byte slice:", b)

	// Print byte slice contents as text
	fmt.Printf("Byte slice as text: %s\n", b)
	fmt.Println("Byte slice as text:", string(b))

	// Length of b
	fmt.Println("Length of b:", len(b))
}

/*
Byte slice: [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
Byte slice: [66 121 116 101 32 115 108 105 99 101 32 226 130 172]
Byte slice as text: Byte slice €
Byte slice as text: Byte slice €
Length of b: 14
*/
```

As Unicode characters like € need more than one byte for their representation, the length of the byte slice might not be the same as the length of the string that it stores.

### Deleting an element from a slice

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"os"
	"strconv"
)

func main() {
	arguments := os.Args
	if len(arguments) == 1 {
		fmt.Println("Need an integer value.")
		return
	}

	index := arguments[1]
	i, err := strconv.Atoi(index)
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println(err)
		return
	}
	fmt.Println("Using index", i)

	aSlice := []int{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}
	fmt.Println("Original slice:", aSlice)

	// Delete element at index i
	if i > len(aSlice)-1 {
		fmt.Println("Cannot delete element", i)
		return
	}

	// The ... operator auto expands aSlice[i+1:] so that
	// its elements can be appended to aSlice[:i] one by one
	aSlice = append(aSlice[:i], aSlice[i+1:]...)
	fmt.Println("After 1st deletion:", aSlice)

	// Delete element at index i
	if i > len(aSlice)-1 {
		fmt.Println("Cannot delete element", i)
		return
	}

	// Replace element at index i with last element
	aSlice[i] = aSlice[len(aSlice)-1]
	// Remove last element
	aSlice = aSlice[:len(aSlice)-1]
	fmt.Println("After 2nd deletion:", aSlice)
}

/*
> go run main.go 2

```

### How slices are connected to arrays

```go

package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func change(s []string) {
	s[0] = "Change_function"
}

func main() {
	a := [4]string{"Zero", "One", "Two", "Three"}
	fmt.Println("a:", a)

	var S0 = a[0:1]
	fmt.Println(S0)
	S0[0] = "S0"

	var S12 = a[1:3]
	fmt.Println(S12)
	S12[0] = "S12_0"
	S12[1] = "S12_1"

	fmt.Println("a:", a)

	// Changes to slice -> changes to array
	change(S12)
	fmt.Println("a:", a)

	// capacity of S0
	fmt.Println("Capacity of S0:", cap(S0), "Length of S0:", len(S0))

	// Adding 4 elements to S0
	S0 = append(S0, "N1")
	S0 = append(S0, "N2")
	S0 = append(S0, "N3")
	a[0] = "-N1"

	// Changing the capacity of S0
	// Not the same underlying array any more!
	S0 = append(S0, "N4")

	fmt.Println("Capacity of S0:", cap(S0), "Length of S0:", len(S0))
	// This change does not go to S0
	a[0] = "-N1-"

	// This change does go to S12
	// Because slice S12 is still connected to array a.
	a[1] = "-N2-"

	fmt.Println("S0:", S0)
	fmt.Println("a: ", a)
	fmt.Println("S12:", S12)
}

/*a: [Zero One Two Three]
[Zero]

*/
```

### The copy() function

```go

package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	a1 := []int{1}
	a2 := []int{-1, -2}
	a5 := []int{10, 11, 12, 13, 14}
	fmt.Println("a1", a1)
	fmt.Println("a2", a2)
	fmt.Println("a5", a5)

	// copy(destination, input)
	// len(a2) > len(a1)
	copy(a1, a2)
	fmt.Println("a1", a1)
	fmt.Println("a2", a2)

	// len(a5) > len(a1)
	copy(a1, a5)
	fmt.Println("a1", a1)
	fmt.Println("a5", a5)

	// len(a2) < len(a5) -> OK
	copy(a5, a2)
	fmt.Println("a2", a2)
	fmt.Println("a5", a5)
}

/*

```

### Sorting slices

```go

package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"sort"
)

func main() {
	sInts := []int{1, 0, 2, -3, 4, -20}
	sFloats := []float64{1.0, 0.2, 0.22, -3, 4.1, -0.1}
	sStrings := []string{"aa", "a", "A", "Aa", "aab", "AAa"}

	fmt.Println("sInts original:", sInts)
	sort.Ints(sInts)
	fmt.Println("sInts:", sInts)
	sort.Sort(sort.Reverse(sort.IntSlice(sInts)))
	fmt.Println("Reverse:", sInts)

	fmt.Println("sFloats original:", sFloats)
	sort.Float64s(sFloats)
	fmt.Println("sFloats:", sFloats)
	sort.Sort(sort.Reverse(sort.Float64Slice(sFloats)))
	fmt.Println("Reverse:", sFloats)

	fmt.Println("sStrings original:", sStrings)
	sort.Strings(sStrings)
	fmt.Println("sStrings:", sStrings)
	sort.Sort(sort.Reverse(sort.StringSlice(sStrings)))
	fmt.Println("Reverse:", sStrings)
}

/*
sInts original: [1 0 2 -3 4 -20]
sInts: [-20 -3 0 1 2 4]
Reverse: [4 2 1 0 -3 -20]
sFloats original: [1 0.2 0.22 -3 4.1 -0.1]

```

So, you can sort a slice of integers saved as `sInts` by typing `sort.Ints(sInts)`. When sorting a slice of integers in reverse order using `sort.Reverse()`, you need to pass the desired slice to `sort.Reverse()` using `sort.IntSlice(sInts)` because the `IntSlice` type implements the `sort.Interface` internally, which allows you to sort in a different way than usual. The same applies to the other standard Go data types.

### Pointers

Go has support for pointers but not for pointer arithmetic, which is the cause of many bugs and errors in programming languages like C. A pointer is the memory address of a variable. You need to dereference a pointer in order to get its value—dereferencing is performed using the * character in front of the pointer variable. Additionally, you can get the memory address of a normal variable using an & in front of it.

The main benefit you get from pointers is that passing a variable to a function as a pointer (we can call that by reference) does not discard any changes you make to the value of that variable inside that function when the function returns.

Remember that slices are passed to functions without the need to use a pointer—it is Go that passes the pointer to the underlying array of a slice and there is no way to change that behavior.

Apart from reasons of simplicity, there exist three more reasons for using pointers: 

- Pointers allow you to share and manipulate data between functions without explicitly returning values back to the caller. However, when sharing data between functions and goroutines, you should be extra careful with race condition issues. This allows multiple functions to try to alter the value of the same pointer variable at the same time, which causes unpredictable behavior in the final state of that pointer variable.
- Pointers are also very handy when you want to tell the difference between the zero value of a variable and a value that is not set (`nil`). This is particularly useful with structures because pointers (and therefore pointers to structures) can have a `nil` value, which means that you can compare a pointer to a structure with a `nil` value, which is not allowed for normal structure variables.
- Having support for pointers and, more specifically, pointers to structures allows Go to support data structures such as linked lists and binary trees, which are widely used in computer science. Therefore, you are allowed to define a structure field of a Node structure as `Next *Node`, which is a pointer to another Node structure. Without pointers, this would have been difficult to implement and possibly too slow.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

type aStructure struct {
	field1 complex128
	field2 int
}

func processPointer(x *float64) {
	*x = *x * *x
}

func returnPointer(x float64) *float64 {
	temp := 2 * x
	return &temp
}

func bothPointers(x *float64) *float64 {
	temp := 2 * *x
	return &temp
}

func main() {
	var f float64 = 12.123
	fmt.Println("Memory address of f:", &f)
	// Pointer to f
	fP := &f
	fmt.Println("Memory address of f:", fP)
	fmt.Println("Value of f:", *fP)
	// The value of f changes
	processPointer(fP)
	fmt.Printf("Value of f: %.2f\n", f)
	// The value of f does not change
	x := returnPointer(f)
	fmt.Printf("Value of x: %.2f\n", *x)
	// The value of f does not change
	xx := bothPointers(fP)
	fmt.Printf("Value of xx: %.2f\n", *xx)

	// Check for empty structure
	var k *aStructure
	// This is nil because currently k points to nowhere
	fmt.Println(k)
	// Therefore you are allowed to do this:
	if k == nil {
		// The new built-in function allocates memory. The first argument is a type, not a value, 
		// and the value returned is a pointer to a newly allocated zero value of that type.
		k = new(aStructure)
	}
	fmt.Printf("%+v\n", k)
	if k != nil {
		fmt.Println("k is not nil!")
	}
}

/*
Memory address of f: 0x14000110018
Memory address of f: 0x14000110018
Value of f: 12.123
Value of f: 146.97
Value of x: 293.93
Value of xx: 293.93
<nil>
&{field1:(0+0i) field2:0}
k is not nil!
*/
```

### Converting a slice to an array or an array pointer

```go

package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func main() {
	// Go 1.17 feature
	slice := make([]byte, 3)
	// Slice to array pointer
	arrayPtr := (*[3]byte)(slice)
	fmt.Println("Print array pointer:", arrayPtr)
	fmt.Printf("Data type: %T\n", arrayPtr)
	fmt.Println("arrayPtr[0]:", arrayPtr[0])

	// Go 1.20 feature
	slice2 := []int{-1, -2, -3}
	// Slice to array
	array := [3]int(slice2)
	fmt.Println("Print array contents:", array)
	fmt.Printf("Data type: %T\n", array)
}

/*
Print array pointer: &[0 0 0]
Data type: *[3]uint8
arrayPtr[0]: 0
Print array contents: [-1 -2 -3]
Data type: [3]int
*/
```

### Data types and the unsafe package

The `unsafe` package in Go provides facilities for performing operations that break the type safety guarantees of Go. It is a powerful but potentially dangerous package, and its use is discouraged in most Go code. Therefore, the `unsafe` package is intended for specific situations where low-level programming is necessary, such as interfacing with non-Go code, dealing with memory layout, or implementing certain advanced features.

In this section, we are going to discuss four functions of the unsafe package that are related to strings and slices. You might not have to use any of them on a regular basis, but it is good to know about them because they provide speed when dealing with large strings or slices that take lots of memory because they deal with memory addresses directly, which might be very dangerous if you do not know what you are doing. The four functions that we are going to discuss are `unsafe.StringData()`, `unsafe.String()`, `unsafe.Slice()`, and `unsafe.SliceData()`.

```go

package main

// https://go101.org/article/unsafe.html

import (
	"fmt"
	"unsafe"
)

func byteToString(bStr []byte) string {
	if len(bStr) == 0 {
		return ""
	}
	return unsafe.String(unsafe.SliceData(bStr), len(bStr))
}

func stringToByte(str string) []byte {
	if str == "" {
		return nil
	}
	return unsafe.Slice(unsafe.StringData(str), len(str))
}

func main() {
	str := "Go!"
	d := unsafe.StringData(str)
	b := unsafe.Slice(d, len(str))
	// byte is an alias for uint8
	fmt.Printf("Type %T contains %s\n", b, b)

	sData := []int{10, 20, 30, 40}
	// Get the memory address of sData
	fmt.Println("Pointer:", unsafe.SliceData(sData))

	// String to Byte slice
	var hi string = "Mastering Go, 4th edition!"
	myByteSlice := stringToByte(hi)
	fmt.Printf("myByteSlice type: %T\n", myByteSlice)

	// Byte slice to string
	myStr := byteToString(myByteSlice)
	fmt.Printf("myStr type: %T\n", myStr)
}

/*
Type []uint8 contains Go!
Pointer: 0x14000022100
myByteSlice type: []uint8
myStr type: string
*/
```

Remember that the most common purpose for using the `unsafe` package is speed when dealing with large amounts of data because it allows you to perform pointer arithmetic and conversions between different pointer types without type safety checks. When dealing with large amounts of data, pointer arithmetic can speed up things.

### Generating random numbers

Random number generation is an art as well as a research area in computer science. This is because computers are purely logical machines, and it turns out that using them to generate random numbers is extremely difficult!

Go can help you with that using the functionality of the `math/rand` package. Each random number generator needs a seed to start producing numbers. The seed is used for initializing the entire process and is extremely important because if you always start with the same seed, you will always get the same sequence of pseudo-random numbers. This means that everybody can regenerate that sequence, and that particular sequence will not be random after all. However, this feature is very handy for testing purposes. In Go, the `rand.Seed()` function is used for initializing a random number generator.

The following function, which is part of randomNumbers.go found in ch02 in the book’s GitHub repository, is what generates random numbers in the `[min, max)` range.

```go
func random(min, max int) int {     
  return rand.Intn(max-min) + min 
}
```

### Generating secure random numbers

```go
package main

import (
	"crypto/rand"
	"encoding/base64"
	"fmt"
	"os"
	"strconv"
)

// This function returns (secure) random bytes
func generateBytes(n int64) ([]byte, error) {
	b := make([]byte, n)
	_, err := rand.Read(b)
	if err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}
	return b, nil
}

func generatePass(s int64) (string, error) {
	b, err := generateBytes(s)
	if err != nil {
		return "", err
	}
	return base64.URLEncoding.EncodeToString(b), nil
}

func main() {
	var LENGTH int64 = 8
	arguments := os.Args
	switch len(arguments) {
	case 2:
		t, err := strconv.ParseInt(os.Args[1], 10, 64)
		if err == nil {
			LENGTH = t
		}
		if LENGTH <= 0 {
			LENGTH = 8
		}
	default:
		fmt.Println("Using default values!")
	}

	myPass, err := generatePass(LENGTH)
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println(err)
		return
	}
	fmt.Println(myPass[0:LENGTH])
}

/*
> go run main.go 6                                                                            

jNZSYc
*/
```

The `rand.Read()` function randomly generates numbers that occupy the entire b byte slice. You need to decode that byte slice using `base64.URLEncoding.EncodeToString(b)` in order to get a valid string without any control or unprintable characters.
