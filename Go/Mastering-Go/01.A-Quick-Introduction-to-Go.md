You rarely see the use of var in Go; the var keyword is mostly used for declaring global or local variables without an initial value. The reason for the former is that every statement that exists outside of the code of a function must begin with a keyword, such as func or var. This means that the short assignment statement cannot be used outside of a function environment because it is not permitted there. Last, you might need to use var when you want to be explicit about the data type. For example, when you want the type of a variable to be int8 or int32 instead of int, which is the default.

Global variables are variables that are defined outside of a function implementation. Global variables can be accessed from anywhere in a package without the need to explicitly pass them to a function, and they can be changed unless they were defined as constants, using the const keyword. Although you can declare local variables using either var or :=, only const and var work for global variables.

The switch statement has two different forms. In the first form, the switch statement has an expression that is evaluated, whereas in the second form, the switch statement has no expression to evaluate. In that case, expressions are evaluated in each case statement, which increases the flexibility of switch.

### Reading from standard input

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func main() {
	// Get User Input
	fmt.Printf("Please give me your name: ")
	var name string
	fmt.Scanln(&name)
	fmt.Println("Your name is", name)
}
```

The [fmt.Scanln()](https://pkg.go.dev/fmt@go1.23.1#Scanln) function can help you read user input while the program is already running and store it to a string variable, which is passed as a pointer to `fmt.Scanln()`. The `fmt` package contains additional functions for reading user input from the console (`os.Stdin`), files, or argument lists. The `fmt.Scanln()` function is rarely used to get user input. Usually, user input is read from command line arguments or external files. However, interactive command line applications need `fmt.Scanln()`.

### Working with command line arguments

```go

package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"os"
	"strconv"
)

func main() {
	arguments := os.Args
	if len(arguments) == 1 {
		fmt.Println("Need one or more arguments!")
		return
	}

	var min, max float64
	var initialized = 0
	for i := 1; i < len(arguments); i++ {
		n, err := strconv.ParseFloat(arguments[i], 64)
		if err != nil {
			continue
		}

		if initialized == 0 {
			min = n
			max = n
			initialized = 1
			continue
		}

		if n < min {
			min = n
		}
		if n > max {
			max = n
		}
	}

	fmt.Println("Min:", min)
	fmt.Println("Max:", max)
}

// go run main.go 1 a b c 6 
// Min: 1
// Max: 6
```

Remember that the first element in `os.Args` is always the path of the executable file, so `os.Args` is never totally empty.

### Using error variables to differentiate between input types

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"os"
	"strconv"
)

func main() {
	arguments := os.Args
	if len(arguments) == 1 {
		fmt.Println("Not enough arguments")
		return
	}

	var total, nInts, nFloats int
	invalid := make([]string, 0)
	for _, k := range arguments[1:] {
		// Is it an integer?
		_, err := strconv.Atoi(k)
		if err == nil {
			total++
			nInts++
			continue
		}
		// Is it a float
		_, err = strconv.ParseFloat(k, 64)
		if err == nil {
			total++
			nFloats++
			continue
		}
		// Then it is invalid
		invalid = append(invalid, k)
	}

	fmt.Println("#read:", total, "#ints:", nInts, "#floats:", nFloats)
	if len(invalid) > total {
		fmt.Println("Too much invalid input:", len(invalid))
		for _, s := range invalid {
			fmt.Println(s)
		}
	}
}

// go run main.go 1 2.3 f w q                                                                 
// #read: 2 #ints: 1 #floats: 1
// Too much invalid input: 3
// f
// w
// q
```

### Developing the which(1) utility in Go

```go

package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"os"
	"path/filepath"
)

func main() {
	arguments := os.Args
	if len(arguments) == 1 {
		fmt.Println("Please provide an argument!")
		return
	}
	file := arguments[1]

	path := os.Getenv("PATH")
	pathSplit := filepath.SplitList(path)
	for _, directory := range pathSplit {
		fullPath := filepath.Join(directory, file)
		// Does it exist?
		fileInfo, err := os.Stat(fullPath)
		if err != nil {
			continue
		}

		mode := fileInfo.Mode()
		// Is it a regular file?
		if !mode.IsRegular() {
			continue
		}

		// Is it executable?
		if mode&0111 != 0 {
			fmt.Println(fullPath)
			return
		}
	}
}

// go run main.go vim                                                                          
// /usr/bin/vim
```

> `mode&0111 != 0`: `0111` is octal, octal `0100` to binary is `1000000`, octal `0010` to binary is `1000`, octal `0001` to binary is `0001`, so octal `0111` to binary is `1001001`. So `mode&0111` actually is `mode&1001001`. [Read more.](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60128401/how-to-check-if-a-file-is-executable-in-go)
