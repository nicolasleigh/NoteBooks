**1.1 What Is the Internet?**

The Internet is a computer network that interconnects billions of computing devices throughout the world. Given the many nontraditional devices that are being hooked up to the Internet, the term computer network is beginning to sound a bit dated. In Internet jargon, all of these devices are called **hosts** or **end systems**.

> In networking jargon, a computer, phone, or [Internet of Things](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things) device connected to a [computer network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network) is sometimes referred to as an **end system** or **end station**, because it sits at the edge of the network. The [end user](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End_user) directly interacts with an end system that provides information or services.
>
> End systems that are connected to the Internet are also referred to as [Internet hosts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_host); this is because they host (run) [Internet applications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rich_web_application) such as [web browsers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser) or [mail servers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mail_server).

End systems are connected together by a network of **communication links** and **packet switches**. There are many types of communication links, which are made up of different types of **physical media**, including **coaxial cable**, **copper wire**, **optical fiber**, and **radio spectrum**. Different links can transmit data at different rates, with the transmission rate of a link measured in bits/second.

> **Physical media** refers to the physical materials that are used to store or transmit information in [data communications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_communications). These physical media are generally physical objects made of materials such as [copper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copper) or [glass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glass).
>
> **Coaxial cable**, or **coax** (pronounced [/ˈkoʊ.æks/](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English)), is a type of [electrical cable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_cable) consisting of an inner [conductor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_conductor) surrounded by a concentric conducting [shield](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_shielding), with the two separated by a [dielectric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dielectric) ([insulating](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulator_(electricity)>) material); many coaxial cables also have a protective outer sheath or jacket. The term _[coaxial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coaxial)_ refers to the inner conductor and the outer shield sharing a geometric axis.

> A **copper wire** is a single [electrical conductor](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_conductor) made of copper. It can be [insulated](<https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulator_(electricity)>) or uninsulated. A **copper cable** is a group of two or more copper [wires](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wire) bundled together in a single sheath or jacket.
>
> An **optical fiber**, or **optical fibre**, is a flexible [glass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glass) or plastic [fiber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber) that can transmit light from one end to the other.
>
> The **radio spectrum** is part of the [electromagnetic spectrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_spectrum) with [frequencies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency) from 3 [Hz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hertz) to 3,000 [GHz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hertz) (3 [THz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hertz)). Electromagnetic waves in this frequency range, called [radio waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_wave), are widely used in modern technology, particularly in [telecommunication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecommunication).

When one end system has data to send to another end system, the sending end system segments the data and adds header bytes to each segment. The resulting packages of information, known as **packets** in the jargon of computer networks, are then sent through the network to the destination end system, where they are reassembled into the original data.

> a **network packet** is a formatted unit of [data](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_(computing)>) carried by a [packet-switched network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packet-switched_network). A packet consists of control information and user data; the latter is also known as the _[payload](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payload_(computing)>)\_. Control information provides data for delivering the payload (e.g., source and destination [network addresses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address), [error detection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_detection) codes, or sequencing information).

A **packet switch** takes a packet arriving on one of its incoming **communication links** and forwards that packet to one of its outgoing communication links. The two most prominent packet switches in today’s Internet are **routers** and **link-layer switches**. Both types of switches forward packets toward their ultimate destinations. Link-layer switches are typically used in **access networks**, while routers are typically used in the **network core**. The sequence of communication links and packet switches traversed by a packet from the sending end system to the receiving end system is known as a **route** or **path** through the network.

> Access networks are the communication networks that connect end-user devices, such as computers, smartphones, and tablets, to a wide area network ([WAN](https://www.techtarget.com/searchnetworking/definition/WAN-wide-area-network)), such as the Internet.
>
> A **backbone** or **core network** is a part of a [computer network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network) which interconnects networks, providing a path for the exchange of information between different [LANs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAN) or [subnetworks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subnetwork).

Thus, in many ways, packets are analogous to trucks, communication links are analogous to highways and roads, packet switches are analogous to intersections, and end systems are analogous to buildings. Just as a truck takes a path through the transportation network, a packet takes a path through a computer network.

End systems access the Internet through **Internet Service Providers** (ISPs), including residential ISPs such as local cable or telephone companies; corporate ISPs; university ISPs; ISPs that provide WiFi access in airports, hotels, coffee shops, and other public places; and cellular data ISPs, providing mobile access to our smartphones and other devices.

ISPs provide a variety of types of network access to the end systems, including residential **broadband** access such as cable modem or DSL, high-speed local area network access, and mobile wireless access. ISPs also provide Internet access to content providers, connecting servers directly to the Internet. The Internet is all about connecting end systems to each other, so the ISPs that provide access to end systems must also be interconnected. These lower-tier ISPs are thus interconnected through national and international upper-tier ISPs and these upper-tier ISPs are connected directly to each other.

> In telecommunications, a broadband signaling method is one that handles a wide band of frequencies. "Broadband" is a relative term, understood according to its context. The wider (or broader) the bandwidth of a channel, the greater the data-carrying capacity, given the same channel quality. In the context of [Internet access](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_access), the term "broadband" is used loosely to mean "access that is always on and faster than the traditional dial-up access".
>
> **Bandwidth** is the difference between the upper and lower [frequencies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency) in a continuous [band of frequencies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_band). It is typically measured in [unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_of_measurement) of [hertz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hertz) (symbol Hz).

The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and the Internet Protocol (IP) are two of the most important **protocols** in the Internet.

> A network protocol is an established set of rules that determine how data is transmitted between different devices in the same network. Essentially, it allows connected devices to communicate with each other, regardless of any differences in their internal processes, structure or design.

All activity in the Internet that involves two or more communicating remote entities is governed by a protocol. For example, hardware-implemented protocols in two physically connected computers control the flow of bits on the “wire” between the two **network interface cards**; congestion-control protocols in end systems control the rate at which packets are transmitted between sender and receiver; protocols in routers determine a packet’s path from source to destination.

> A **network interface controller** (**NIC**, also known as a **network interface card**, **network adapter**, **LAN adapter**, and **physical network interface**) is a [computer hardware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_hardware) component that connects a [computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer) to a [computer network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network). Network interface controllers were originally implemented as expansion cards that plugged into a computer bus. The low cost and ubiquity of the Ethernet standard mean that most new computers have a network interface controller built into the motherboard.

**1.2 The Network Edge**

Hosts are sometimes further divided into two categories: clients and servers. Informally, clients tend to be desktops, laptops, smartphones, and so on, whereas servers tend to be more powerful machines that store and distribute Web pages, stream video, relay e-mail, and so on. Today, most of the servers from which we receive search results, e-mail, Web pages, videos and mobile app content reside in large data centers.

Today, the two most prevalent types of broadband residential access are **digital subscriber line** (**DSL**) and **cable**. A residence typically obtains DSL Internet access from the same local telephone company (telco) that provides its wired local phone access. Thus, when DSL is used, a customer’s telco is also its ISP. Each customer’s DSL modem uses the existing telephone line exchange data with a **digital subscriber line access multiplexer** (**DSLAM**) located in the telco’s local central office (CO). The home’s DSL modem takes digital data and translates it to high-frequency tones for transmission over telephone wires to the CO; the analog signals from many such houses are translated back into digital format at the DSLAM.

> **Digital subscriber line** (**DSL**; originally **digital subscriber loop**) is a family of technologies that are used to transmit [digital data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_data) over [telephone lines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone_line). In telecommunications marketing, the term DSL is widely understood to mean [asymmetric digital subscriber line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymmetric_digital_subscriber_line) (ADSL), the most commonly installed DSL technology, for [Internet access](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_access). In ADSL, the data throughput in the [upstream](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upstream_(networking)>) direction (the direction to the service provider) is lower, hence the designation of _asymmetric_ service.
>
> A DSL modem uses a phone line to connect to the Internet, while a cable modem uses a cable TV line. One of the main difference between DSL modem and cable modem is that a DSL modem uses your home’s existing copper phone line while a cable modem uses a coaxial cable line.

> A **digital subscriber line access multiplexer** (**DSLAM**, often pronounced _DEE-slam_) is a network device, often located in [telephone exchanges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone_exchange), that connects multiple customer [digital subscriber line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_subscriber_line) (DSL) interfaces to a high-speed digital communications channel using [multiplexing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplexing) techniques.

While DSL makes use of the telco’s existing local telephone infrastructure, cable Internet access makes use of the cable television company’s existing cable television infrastructure. Fiber optics connect the **cable television headend** to neighborhood-level junctions, from which traditional **coaxial cable** is then used to reach individual houses and apartments. Each neighborhood junction typically supports 500 to 5,000 homes. Because both fiber and coaxial cable are employed in this system, it is often referred to as **hybrid fiber coax** (**HFC**).

**Cable internet access** requires special modems, called **cable modems**. As with a DSL modem, the cable modem is typically an external device and connects to the home PC through an Ethernet port. At the cable headend, the **cable modem termination system** (**CMTS**) serves a similar function as the DSL network’s DSLAM—turning the analog signal sent from the cable modems in many downstream homes back into digital format. Cable modems divide the HFC network into two channels, a downstream and an upstream channel. As with DSL, access is typically asymmetric, with the downstream channel typically allocated a higher transmission rate than the upstream channel.

> A **cable modem termination system** (**CMTS**, also called a **CMTS Edge Router**) is a piece of [equipment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equipment_rental), typically [located](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Located) in a cable company's [headend](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cable_television_headend), which is used to provide data [services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_service), such as [cable Internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cable_modem) or [Voice over IP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_over_IP), to cable subscribers. A CMTS provides many of the same functions provided by the [DSLAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DSLAM) in a [DSL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_subscriber_line) system.

One important characteristic of **cable Internet access** is that it is a shared broadcast medium. In particular, every packet sent by the headend travels downstream on every link to every home and every packet sent by a home travels on the upstream channel to the headend. For this reason, if several users are simultaneously downloading a video file on the downstream channel, the actual rate at which each user receives its video file will be significantly lower than the aggregate cable downstream rate. On the other hand, if there are only a few active users and they are all Web surfing, then each of the users may actually receive Web pages at the full cable downstream rate, because the users will rarely request a Web page at exactly the same time. Because the upstream channel is also shared, a distributed multiple access protocol is needed to coordinate transmissions and avoid collisions.

Although DSL and cable networks currently represent the majority of residential broadband access, an up-and-coming technology that provides even higher speeds is fiber to the home (FTTH). As the name suggests, the FTTH concept is simple—provide an optical fiber path from the central office(CO) directly to the home. FTTH can potentially provide Internet access rates in the gigabits per second range.
