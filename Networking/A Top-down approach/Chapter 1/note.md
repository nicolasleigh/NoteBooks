**What Is the Internet?**

The Internet is a computer network that interconnects billions of computing devices throughout the world. Given the many nontraditional devices that are being hooked up to the Internet, the term computer network is beginning to sound a bit dated. In Internet jargon, all of these devices are called **hosts** or **end systems**.

> In networking jargon, a computer, phone, or [Internet of Things](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things) device connected to a [computer network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network) is sometimes referred to as an **end system** or **end station**, because it sits at the edge of the network. The [end user](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End_user) directly interacts with an end system that provides information or services.
>
> End systems that are connected to the Internet are also referred to as [Internet hosts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_host); this is because they host (run) [Internet applications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rich_web_application) such as [web browsers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser) or [mail servers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mail_server).

End systems are connected together by a network of **communication links** and **packet switches**. There are many types of communication links, which are made up of different types of **physical media**, including **coaxial cable**, **copper wire**, **optical fiber**, and **radio spectrum**. Different links can transmit data at different rates, with the transmission rate of a link measured in bits/second.

> **Physical media** refers to the physical materials that are used to store or transmit information in [data communications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_communications). These physical media are generally physical objects made of materials such as [copper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copper) or [glass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glass).

> **Coaxial cable**, or **coax** (pronounced [/ˈkoʊ.æks/](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English)), is a type of [electrical cable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_cable) consisting of an inner [conductor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_conductor) surrounded by a concentric conducting [shield](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_shielding), with the two separated by a [dielectric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dielectric) ([insulating](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulator_(electricity)>) material); many coaxial cables also have a protective outer sheath or jacket. The term _[coaxial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coaxial)_ refers to the inner conductor and the outer shield sharing a geometric axis.

> A **copper wire** is a single [electrical conductor](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_conductor) made of copper. It can be [insulated](<https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulator_(electricity)>) or uninsulated. A **copper cable** is a group of two or more copper [wires](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wire) bundled together in a single sheath or jacket.
>
> An **optical fiber**, or **optical fibre**, is a flexible [glass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glass) or plastic [fiber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber) that can transmit light from one end to the other.
>
> The **radio spectrum** is part of the [electromagnetic spectrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_spectrum) with [frequencies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency) from 3 [Hz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hertz) to 3,000 [GHz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hertz) (3 [THz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hertz)). Electromagnetic waves in this frequency range, called [radio waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_wave), are widely used in modern technology, particularly in [telecommunication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecommunication).
