**What Is the Internet?**

The Internet is a computer network that interconnects billions of computing devices throughout the world. Given the many nontraditional devices that are being hooked up to the Internet, the term computer network is beginning to sound a bit dated. In Internet jargon, all of these devices are called **hosts** or **end systems**.

> In networking jargon, a computer, phone, or [Internet of Things](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things) device connected to a [computer network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network) is sometimes referred to as an **end system** or **end station**, because it sits at the edge of the network. The [end user](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End_user) directly interacts with an end system that provides information or services.
>
> End systems that are connected to the Internet are also referred to as [Internet hosts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_host); this is because they host (run) [Internet applications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rich_web_application) such as [web browsers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser) or [mail servers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mail_server).

End systems are connected together by a network of **communication links** and **packet switches**. There are many types of communication links, which are made up of different types of **physical media**, including **coaxial cable**, **copper wire**, **optical fiber**, and **radio spectrum**. Different links can transmit data at different rates, with the transmission rate of a link measured in bits/second.

> **Physical media** refers to the physical materials that are used to store or transmit information in [data communications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_communications). These physical media are generally physical objects made of materials such as [copper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copper) or [glass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glass).
>
> **Coaxial cable**, or **coax** (pronounced [/ˈkoʊ.æks/](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English)), is a type of [electrical cable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_cable) consisting of an inner [conductor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_conductor) surrounded by a concentric conducting [shield](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_shielding), with the two separated by a [dielectric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dielectric) ([insulating](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulator_(electricity)>) material); many coaxial cables also have a protective outer sheath or jacket. The term _[coaxial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coaxial)_ refers to the inner conductor and the outer shield sharing a geometric axis.

> A **copper wire** is a single [electrical conductor](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_conductor) made of copper. It can be [insulated](<https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulator_(electricity)>) or uninsulated. A **copper cable** is a group of two or more copper [wires](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wire) bundled together in a single sheath or jacket.
>
> An **optical fiber**, or **optical fibre**, is a flexible [glass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glass) or plastic [fiber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber) that can transmit light from one end to the other.
>
> The **radio spectrum** is part of the [electromagnetic spectrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_spectrum) with [frequencies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency) from 3 [Hz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hertz) to 3,000 [GHz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hertz) (3 [THz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hertz)). Electromagnetic waves in this frequency range, called [radio waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_wave), are widely used in modern technology, particularly in [telecommunication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecommunication).

When one end system has data to send to another end system, the sending end system segments the data and adds header bytes to each segment. The resulting packages of information, known as **packets** in the jargon of computer networks, are then sent through the network to the destination end system, where they are reassembled into the original data.

> a **network packet** is a formatted unit of [data](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_(computing)>) carried by a [packet-switched network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packet-switched_network). A packet consists of control information and user data; the latter is also known as the _[payload](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payload_(computing)>)_. Control information provides data for delivering the payload (e.g., source and destination [network addresses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address), [error detection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_detection) codes, or sequencing information).

A **packet switch** takes a packet arriving on one of its incoming **communication links** and forwards that packet to one of its outgoing communication links. The two most prominent packet switches in today’s Internet are **routers** and **link-layer switches**. Both types of switches forward packets toward their ultimate destinations. Link-layer switches are typically used in **access networks**, while routers are typically used in the **network core**. The sequence of communication links and packet switches traversed by a packet from the sending end system to the receiving end system is known as a **route** or **path** through the network.

> Access networks are the communication networks that connect end-user devices, such as computers, smartphones, and tablets, to a wide area network ([WAN](https://www.techtarget.com/searchnetworking/definition/WAN-wide-area-network)), such as the Internet.
>
> A **backbone** or **core network** is a part of a [computer network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network) which interconnects networks, providing a path for the exchange of information between different [LANs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAN) or [subnetworks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subnetwork).

Thus, in many ways, packets are analogous to trucks, communication links are analogous to highways and roads, packet switches are analogous to intersections, and end systems are analogous to buildings. Just as a truck takes a path through the transportation network, a packet takes a path through a computer network.

End systems access the Internet through **Internet Service Providers** (ISPs), including residential ISPs such as local cable or telephone companies; corporate ISPs; university ISPs; ISPs that provide WiFi access in airports, hotels, coffee shops, and other public places; and cellular data ISPs, providing mobile access to our smartphones and other devices.

ISPs provide a variety of types of network access to the end systems, including residential **broadband** access such as cable modem or DSL, high-speed local area network access, and mobile wireless access. ISPs also provide Internet access to content providers, connecting servers directly to the Internet. The Internet is all about connecting end systems to each other, so the ISPs that provide access to end systems must also be interconnected. These lower-tier ISPs are thus interconnected through national and international upper-tier ISPs and these upper-tier ISPs are connected directly to each other.

> In telecommunications, a broadband signaling method is one that handles a wide band of frequencies. "Broadband" is a relative term, understood according to its context. The wider (or broader) the bandwidth of a channel, the greater the data-carrying capacity, given the same channel quality. In the context of [Internet access](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_access), the term "broadband" is used loosely to mean "access that is always on and faster than the traditional dial-up access".
>
> **Bandwidth** is the difference between the upper and lower [frequencies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency) in a continuous [band of frequencies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_band). It is typically measured in [unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_of_measurement) of [hertz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hertz) (symbol Hz).

The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and the Internet Protocol (IP) are two of the most important **protocols** in the Internet.

> A network protocol is an established set of rules that determine how data is transmitted between different devices in the same network. Essentially, it allows connected devices to communicate with each other, regardless of any differences in their internal processes, structure or design.

All activity in the Internet that involves two or more communicating remote entities is governed by a protocol. For example, hardware-implemented protocols in two physically connected computers control the flow of bits on the “wire” between the two **network interface cards**; congestion-control protocols in end systems control the rate at which packets are transmitted between sender and receiver; protocols in routers determine a packet’s path from source to destination.

> A **network interface controller** (**NIC**, also known as a **network interface card**, **network adapter**, **LAN adapter**, and **physical network interface**) is a [computer hardware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_hardware) component that connects a [computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer) to a [computer network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network). Network interface controllers were originally implemented as expansion cards that plugged into a computer bus. The low cost and ubiquity of the Ethernet standard mean that most new computers have a network interface controller built into the motherboard.
