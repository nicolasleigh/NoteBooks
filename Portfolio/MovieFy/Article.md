### Project Overview

MovieFy is a full-featured movie app designed with two distinct interfaces: one for regular users and one for administrators. The platform allows users to watch movies, explore detailed information like cast and genres, read and write reviews with star ratings, and enjoy the experience in multiple languages and themes. On the admin side, the app provides tools to manage the movie database, including adding and editing movies and actor profiles.

### Motivation

The idea behind MovieFy was to build a platform that mimics a real-world movie streaming and review app, integrating both user experience design and content management capabilities. It was created as a personal project to deepen my full-stack development skills, with a focus on multilingual support and modern UI/UX practices.

### My Role

This was a solo project, and I was responsible for the entire development lifecycle. My key contributions included:

* Designing intuitive, responsive UI/UX for both the user and admin interfaces.
* Developing the full-stack application, including both frontend and backend logic.
* Implementing secure user authentication to protect user data and restrict admin access.
* Containerizing the application using Docker for streamlined development and deployment.
* Configuring Caddy as both a static file server and reverse proxy, ensuring efficient and secure routing.

### Development Process

1. Design: Created responsive UI mockups for both user and admin views, with a strong focus on accessibility, readability, and consistent visual language.
2. Frontend Development: Built the user and admin interfaces using React and Tailwind CSS, ensuring a modern, clean, and responsive experience.
3. Backend Development: Developed a set of RESTful APIs using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB to handle movies, actors, and reviews.
4. Localization & Theming: Implemented a dynamic language switcher supporting English and Chinese, and added a dark/light mode toggle for personalized user experience.
5. Deployment: Containerized the application with Docker and deployed it on a Linux server, using Caddy as a static file server and reverse proxy for seamless routing.

### Tech Stack

* Frontend: React
* Styling & Theming: Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui (component library)
* Backend: Node.js, Express
* Database: MongoDB
* Authentication: JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
* Internationalization: react-i18next

### Key Features

#### User Side

* Watch movies and search by title
* View detailed movie information, including lead actors, genres, and related films
* Read and write reviews with interactive star-based ratings

#### Admin Side

* Create, edit, and delete movie entries
* Manage actor profiles, including names and images
* View and monitor recent user-submitted reviews

### Challenges & Solutions

Throughout the development of MovieFy, I encountered and solved several complex technical challenges that significantly shaped the robustness and user experience of the app.

1. Complex Admin Form with Rich Functionality

Challenge: 

Building an advanced movie form in the admin panel that needed to handle:

- Form validation
- A clean, responsive UI
- Multi-language support (English & Chinese)
- Smooth user experience
- Live actor search
- Video and image uploads

Solution: 

I tackled this by combining several modern tools:

- UI/UX: Built using `shadcn/ui` components for a cohesive look and feel
- Form Validation: Integrated `Zod` with `react-hook-form` for schema-based validation and control
- Localization: Used `react-i18next` for seamless language switching
- Live Search: Implemented a debounced search function to fetch actor data efficiently
- File Uploads: Handled video and image uploads with custom form controls integrated into the submission flow

2. Custom Authentication & Authorization

**Challenge:** 

Implementing secure user authentication and role-based access, including:

- Email verification
- Restricting certain features to verified users only
- Login state tracking
- Password reset functionality

Solution: 

- Email Verification: Used Resend to automatically send account activation emails with verification tokens
- Access Control: Restricted review and rating features to only verified users
- Session Management: Managed authentication state using JWT
- Password Recovery: Implemented a password reset flow that securely sends a reset link to the user’s email

### What I Learned

Working on MovieFy was an incredibly rewarding experience that challenged me to think like a full-stack developer, product designer, and system architect — all at once. Here are some of the key takeaways from this project:

* Balancing complexity with usability: Designing a feature-rich admin interface taught me how to structure complex forms while maintaining a clean and intuitive user experience.
* Power of modern tooling: I gained deeper expertise in tools like `react-hook-form`, `Zod`, and `shadcn/ui`, which allowed me to build scalable and maintainable interfaces.
* Internationalization matters: Supporting multiple languages made me more conscious of content structure, dynamic UI adjustments, and the importance of planning for global users from the start.
* Security and user experience go hand-in-hand: Implementing custom authentication with email verification and password recovery reinforced how security features can be both robust and user-friendly when thoughtfully integrated.
* Deployment & DevOps fundamentals: Using Docker and configuring a production-ready setup with Caddy gave me hands-on experience in deploying, managing, and serving full-stack apps efficiently.

Overall, MovieFy not only improved my technical skill set but also deepened my appreciation for building polished, production-ready software that can scale and serve real users.

### Future Improvements

While MovieFy successfully demonstrates my full-stack development capabilities, I've identified several areas for enhancement in future iterations:

1. Automated Testing Implementation
   * Add comprehensive unit and integration tests to ensure reliability
   * Implement end-to-end testing to verify critical user flows
   * Set up test coverage reporting to maintain code quality
2. Enhanced Error Handling
   * Develop a standardized error code system to support multi-language error messages
   * Implement consistent error handling patterns across both frontend and backend
   * Create user-friendly error states that maintain excellent UX even when things go wrong
3. Application Monitoring
   * Integrate logging and monitoring solutions to track application performance
   * Set up alert systems for critical errors and performance bottlenecks
   * Implement analytics to gain insights into user behavior and feature usage
4. CI/CD Pipeline with Jenkins
   * Establish automated build, test, and deployment workflows
   * Configure Jenkins to streamline the development-to-production process
   * Implement quality gates to ensure only validated code reaches production
5. Code Refactoring
   * Improve component structure and reusability
   * Enhance state management patterns
   * Optimize database queries and API endpoints
6. Server Performance Optimization
   * Implement rate limiting to protect against abuse
   * Add load balancing to distribute traffic efficiently
   * Enhance caching strategies for faster content delivery

### Summary

MovieFy is a full-stack movie app designed to deliver a seamless experience for both users and administrators. Users can watch movies, explore detailed information, and engage by writing reviews with ratings. On the backend, admins can efficiently manage movies and actor data through a custom-built interface.

Throughout this project, I designed and developed the entire system — from user interface to authentication flow and deployment — gaining practical experience in modern frontend and backend technologies, internationalization, DevOps, and UX best practices.

This project has been an invaluable learning experience and a significant step forward in my journey as a full-stack developer.
