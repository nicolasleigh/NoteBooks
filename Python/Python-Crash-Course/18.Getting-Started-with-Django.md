## Getting Started with Django

### Setting Up a Project

#### Creating a Virtual Environment

To work with Django, we’ll first set up a virtual environment. A **virtual environment** is a place on your system where you can install packages and isolate them from all other Python packages.

```sh
python -m venv ll_env
```

#### Activating the Virtual Environment

```sh
source ll_env/bin/activate
```

#### Installing Django

```sh
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install django
```

#### Creating a Project in Django

```sh
django-admin startproject ll_project .
```

The `startproject` command tells Django to set up a new project called `ll_project`. The dot (`.`) at the end of the command creates the new project with a directory structure that will make it easy to deploy the app to a server when we’re finished developing it.

#### Creating the Database

```sh
python manage.py migrate
```

#### Viewing the Project

```sh
python manage.py runserver
```

**Note**: If you receive the error message “That port is already in use,” tell Django to use a different port by entering `python manage.py runserver 8001` and then cycling through higher numbers until you find an open port.

### Starting an App

A Django **project** is organized as a group of individual **apps** that work together to make the project work as a whole.

```sh
python manage.py startapp learning_logs
```

The command `startapp appname` tells Django to create the infrastructure needed to build an app.

#### Defining Models

A **model** tells Django how to work with the data that will be stored in the app. A model is a class; it has attributes and methods, just like every class we’ve discussed.

```py
# models.py

from django.db import models

# Create your models here.
class Topic(models.Model):   
	"""A topic the user is learning about.""" 
	text = models.CharField(max_length=200) 
	date_added = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True) 

	def __str__(self):    
		"""Return a string representation of the model."""   
		return self.text
```

#### Activating Models

```py
# settings.py

...

# Application definition

INSTALLED_APPS = [
    'django.contrib.admin',
    'django.contrib.auth',
    'django.contrib.contenttypes',
    'django.contrib.sessions',
    'django.contrib.messages',
    'django.contrib.staticfiles',
    'learning_logs.apps.LearningLogsConfig' # New
]

...
```

Next, we need to tell Django to modify the database so it can store information related to the model `Topic`.

```sh
python manage.py makemigrations learning_logs
```

Now we’ll apply this migration and have Django modify the database for us:

```sh
python manage.py migrate
```

Whenever we want to modify the data that Learning Log manages, we’ll follow these three steps: modify `models.py`, call `makemigrations` on `learning_logs`, and tell Django to `migrate` the project.

#### The Django Admin Site

##### Setting Up a Superuser

```sh
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

##### Registering a Model with the Admin Site

```py
# admin.py

from django.contrib import admin

# Register your models here.
from .models import Topic

admin.site.register(Topic)
```

#### Defining the Entry Model

```py
# models.py

...

class Entry(models.Model):   
	"""Something specific learned about a topic.""" 
	topic = models.ForeignKey(Topic, on_delete=models.CASCADE) 
	text = models.TextField()   
	date_added = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True) 

	class Meta:   
		verbose_name_plural = 'entries'   

	def __str__(self):    
		"""Return a simple string representing the entry.""" 
		return f"{self.text[:50]}..."
```

The `Meta` class is nested inside the `Entry` class. The `Meta` class holds extra information for managing a model; here, it lets us set a special attribute telling Django to use `Entries` when it needs to refer to more than one entry. Without this, Django would refer to multiple entries as `Entrys`.

#### Migrating the Entry Model

Because we’ve added a new model, we need to migrate the database again. This process will become quite familiar: you modify `models.py`, run the command `python manage.py makemigrations app_name`, and then run the command `python manage.py migrate`.

```sh
python manage.py makemigrations learning_logs

python manage.py migrate
```

#### Registering Entry with the Admin Site

```py
from django.contrib import admin

# Register your models here.
from .models import Topic, Entry # New

admin.site.register(Topic)
admin.site.register(Entry) # New
```

#### The Django Shell

```sh
python manage.py shell

>>> from learning_logs.models import Topic 
>>> Topic.objects.all()
<QuerySet [<Topic: Chess>, <Topic: Rock Climbing>]>

>>> topics = Topic.objects.all() 
>>> for topic in topics: 
...     print(topic.id, topic) 
...
1 Chess 
2 Rock Climbing

>>> t = Topic.objects.get(id=1) 
>>> t.text 
'Chess' 
>>> t.date_added 
datetime.datetime(2024, 11, 22, 3, 56, 45, 664331, tzinfo=datetime.timezone.utc)

>>> t.entry_set.all()
<QuerySet [<Entry: The opening is the first part of the game, roughly...>, <Entry: In the opening phase of the game, it’s important t...>]>
```

### Making Pages: The Learning Log Home Page

Making web pages with Django consists of three stages: defining URLs, writing views, and writing templates. You can do these in any order, but in this project we’ll always start by defining the URL pattern. A URL pattern describes the way the URL is laid out. It also tells Django what to look for when matching a browser request with a site URL, so it knows which page to return.

#### Mapping a URL

```py
# ll_project/urls.py

from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path, include

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('', include('learning_logs.urls'))  # New
]
```

```py
# learning_logs/urls.py

"""Defines URL patterns for learning_logs.""" 
from django.urls import path 

from . import views 

app_name = 'learning_logs' 
urlpatterns = [   
    # Home page   
    path('', views.index, name='index'), 
]
```

The variable `app_name` helps Django distinguish this `urls.py` file from files of the same name in other apps within the project. The variable `urlpatterns` in this module is a list of individual pages that can be requested from the `learning_logs` app

Django receives the requested URL and tries to route the request to a view. It does this by searching all the URL patterns we’ve defined to find one that matches the current request. Django ignores the base URL for the project (`http://localhost:8000/`), so the empty string ('') matches the base URL. Any other URL won’t match this pattern, and Django will return an error page if the URL requested doesn’t match any existing URL patterns.

The second argument in `path()` specifies which function to call in `views.py`. When a requested URL matches the pattern we’re defining, Django calls the `index()` function from `views.py`. The third argument provides the name `index` for this URL pattern so we can refer to it more easily in other files throughout the project. Whenever we want to provide a link to the home page, we’ll use this name instead of writing out a URL.

#### Writing a View

```py
# learning_logs/views.py

from django.shortcuts import render

# Create your views here.
def index(request): 
  """The home page for Learning Log."""   
  return render(request, 'learning_logs/index.html')
```

#### Writing a Template

```html
<!-- learning_logs/templates/learning_logs/index.html -->

<p>Learning Log</p>

<p>Learning Log helps you keep track of your learning, for any topic you're interested in.</p>
```

### Building Additional Pages

#### Template Inheritance

When building a website, some elements will need to be repeated on each page. Rather than writing these elements directly into each page, you can write a base template containing the repeated elements and then have each page inherit from the base.

##### The Parent Template

We’ll create a template called `base.html` in the same directory as `index.html`.  This file will contain elements common to all pages; every other template will inherit from `base.html`.

```html
<!-- learning_logs/templates/learning_logs/base.html -->

<p>
  <a href="{% url 'learning_logs:index' %}">Learning Log</a>
</p>

{% block content %}{% endblock content %}
```

To generate a link, we use a **template tag**, which is indicated by braces and percent signs (`{% %}`). A template tag generates information to be displayed on a page. The template tag `{% url 'learning_logs:index' %}` shown here generates a URL matching the URL pattern defined in `learning_logs/urls.py` with the name '`index`'. In this example, `learning_logs` is the namespace and `index` is a uniquely named URL pattern in that namespace. The namespace comes from the value we assigned to `app_name` in the `learning_logs/urls.py` file.

On the last line, we insert a pair of `block` tags. This block, named `content`, is a placeholder; the child template will define the kind of information that goes in the `content` block.

A child template doesn’t have to define every block from its parent, so you can reserve space in parent templates for as many blocks as you like; the child template uses only as many as it needs.

##### The Child Template

Now we need to rewrite `index.html` to inherit from `base.html`. Add the following code to `index.html`:

```html
<!-- learning_logs/templates/learning_logs/index.html -->

{% extends 'learning_logs/base.html' %}

{% block content %}
<p>Learning Log helps you keep track of your learning, for any topic you're interested in.</p>
{% endblock content %}
```

#### The Topics Page

##### The Topics URL Pattern

```py
# learning_logs/urls.py

"""Defines URL patterns for learning_logs.""" 
from django.urls import path 

from . import views 

app_name = 'learning_logs' 

urlpatterns = [   
    # Home page   
    path('', views.index, name='index'), 
    # Page that shows all topics.
    path('topics/', views.topics, name='topics'),  # New
]
```

##### The Topics View

```py
# learning_logs/views.py

from django.shortcuts import render

from .models import Topic

...

def topics(request):   
	"""Show all topics.""" 
	topics = Topic.objects.order_by('date_added') 
	context = {'topics': topics} 
	return render(request, 'learning_logs/topics.html', context)
```

##### The Topics Template

```html
<!-- learning_logs/templates/learning_logs/topics.html -->

{% extends 'learning_logs/base.html' %}

{% block content %}  
<p>Topics</p>
<ul> 
  {% for topic in topics %} 
    <li>{{ topic.text }}</li> 
  {% empty %}    
    <li>No topics have been added yet.</li> 
  {% endfor %} 
</ul> 
{% endblock content %}
```

In a template, every `for` loop needs an explicit `{% endfor %}` tag indicating where the end of the loop occurs.

We also use the `{% empty %}` template tag, which tells Django what to do if there are no items in the list. In this case, we print a message informing the user that no topics have been added yet.

Now we need to modify the base template to include a link to the topics page. Add the following code to `base.html`:

```html
<!-- learning_logs/templates/learning_logs/base.html -->

<p>
  <a href="{% url 'learning_logs:index' %}">Learning Log</a> -
  <a href="{% url 'learning_logs:topics' %}">Topics</a>
</p>

{% block content %}{% endblock content %}
```

#### Individual Topic Pages

##### The Topic URL Pattern

```py
# learning_logs/urls.py

...

app_name = 'learning_logs' 

urlpatterns = [   
    # Home page   
    path('', views.index, name='index'), 
    # Page that shows all topics.
    path('topics/', views.topics, name='topics'),
    # Detail page for a single topic.
    path('topics/<int:topic_id>/', views.topic, name='topic'),  # New
]
```

##### The Topic View

```py
# learning_logs/views.py

...

def index(request): 
	"""The home page for Learning Log."""   
	return render(request, 'learning_logs/index.html')

def topics(request):   
	"""Show all topics.""" 
	topics = Topic.objects.order_by('date_added') 
	context = {'topics': topics} 
	return render(request, 'learning_logs/topics.html', context)

# New
def topic(request, topic_id):  
	"""Show a single topic and all its entries.""" 
	topic = Topic.objects.get(id=topic_id) 
	entries = topic.entry_set.order_by('-date_added') 
	context = {'topic': topic, 'entries': entries} 
	return render(request, 'learning_logs/topic.html', context)
```

The code `topic = Topic.objects.get(id=topic_id)` and `entries = topic.entry_set.order_by('-date_added')` are called queries, because they query the database for specific information. When you’re writing queries like these in your own projects, it’s helpful to try them out in the Django `shell` first. You’ll get much quicker feedback in the shell than you would by writing a view and template and then checking the results in a browser.

##### The Topic Template

```html
<!-- learning_logs/templates/learning_logs/topic.html -->

{% extends 'learning_logs/base.html' %} 

{% block content %} 
  <p>Topic: {{ topic.text }}</p> 
  <p>Entries:</p> 
  <ul> 
    {% for entry in entries %}    
    <li> 
      <p>{{ entry.date_added|date:'M d, Y H:i' }}</p> 
      <p>{{ entry.text|linebreaks }}</p>   
    </li> 
    {% empty %} 
    <li>There are no entries for this topic yet.</li>   
    {% endfor %} 
  </ul> 
{% endblock content %}
```

In Django templates, a vertical line (`|`) represents a template **filter**—a function that modifies the value in a template variable during the rendering process. The filter `date:'M d, Y H:i'` displays timestamps in the format `January 1, 2022 23:00`. The next line displays the value of the current entry’s text attribute. The filter `linebreaks` ensures that long text entries include line breaks in a format understood by browsers, rather than showing a block of uninterrupted text.

##### Links from the Topics Page

```html
<!-- learning_logs/templates/learning_logs/topics.html -->

{% extends 'learning_logs/base.html' %}

{% block content %}  
<p>Topics</p>
<ul> 
  {% for topic in topics %} 
    <li>     
    	<!--New-->
      <a href="{% url 'learning_logs:topic' topic.id %}">{{ topic.text }}</a> 
    </li>
  {% empty %}    
    <li>No topics have been added yet.</li> 
  {% endfor %} 
</ul> 
{% endblock content %}
```
