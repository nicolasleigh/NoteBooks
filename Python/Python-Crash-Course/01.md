## Introducing Lists

### Modifying, Adding, and Removing Elements

#### Modifying Elements in a List

```py
motorcycles = ['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki'] 
print(motorcycles) 

motorcycles[0] = 'ducati' 
print(motorcycles)
```

#### Adding Elements to a List

##### Appending Elements to the End of a List

```py
motorcycles = ['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki'] 
print(motorcycles) 

motorcycles.append('ducati')  # New
print(motorcycles)
```

##### Inserting Elements into a List

```py
motorcycles = ['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki'] 

motorcycles.insert(0, 'ducati') 	# New
print(motorcycles)
```

#### Removing Elements from a List

##### Removing an Item Using the del Statement

```py
motorcycles = ['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki'] 
print(motorcycles) 

del motorcycles[0] 	# New
print(motorcycles)
```

##### Removing an Item Using the pop() Method

```py
motorcycles = ['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki'] 
print(motorcycles) 

popped_motorcycle = motorcycles.pop()  # New
print(motorcycles) 
print(popped_motorcycle)
```

```py
motorcycles = ['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki'] 

last_owned = motorcycles.pop() 
print(f"The last motorcycle I owned was a {last_owned.title()}.")
```

##### Popping Items from Any Position in a List

```py
motorcycles = ['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki'] 

first_owned = motorcycles.pop(0)  # New
print(f"The first motorcycle I owned was a {first_owned.title()}.")
```

If you’re unsure whether to use the del statement or the `pop()` method, here’s a simple way to decide: when you want to delete an item from a list and not use that item in any way, use the del statement; if you want to use an item as you remove it, use the `pop()` method.

##### Removing an Item by Value

Sometimes you won’t know the position of the value you want to remove from a list. If you only know the value of the item you want to remove, you can use the `remove()` method.

```py
motorcycles = ['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki', 'ducati'] 
print(motorcycles) 

motorcycles.remove('ducati')  # New
print(motorcycles)
```

**Note**: The `remove()` method deletes only the first occurrence of the value you specify. If there’s a possibility the value appears more than once in the list, you’ll need to use a loop to make sure all occurrences of the value are removed.

### Organizing a List

#### Sorting a List Permanently with the sort() Method

```py
cars = ['bmw', 'audi', 'toyota', 'subaru'] 
cars.sort() 
print(cars)
```

You can also sort this list in reverse-alphabetical order by passing the argument `reverse=True` to the `sort()` method.

```py
cars = ['bmw', 'audi', 'toyota', 'subaru'] 
cars.sort(reverse=True)  # New
print(cars)
```

#### Sorting a List Temporarily with the sorted() Function

To maintain the original order of a list but present it in a sorted order, you can use the `sorted()` function. The `sorted()` function lets you display your list in a particular order, but doesn’t affect the actual order of the list.

```py
cars = ['bmw', 'audi', 'toyota', 'subaru'] 

print("Here is the original list:") 
print(cars) 

print("\nHere is the sorted list:") 
print(sorted(cars))  # New

print("\nHere is the original list again:") 
print(cars)
```

#### Printing a List in Reverse Order

```py
cars = ['bmw', 'audi', 'toyota', 'subaru'] 
print(cars) 

cars.reverse() 
print(cars)
```

The `reverse()` method changes the order of a list permanently, but you can revert to the original order anytime by applying `reverse()` to the same list a second time.

#### Finding the Length of a List

```py
cars = ['bmw', 'audi', 'toyota', 'subaru'] 
len(cars)  # 4
```

### Avoiding Index Errors When Working with Lists

Keep in mind that whenever you want to access the last item in a list, you should use the index `-1`. 

```py
motorcycles = ['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki'] 
print(motorcycles[-1])
```

The only time this approach will cause an error is when you request the last item from an empty list.

## Working with Lists

### Looping Through an Entire List

```py
magicians = ['alice', 'david', 'carolina'] 
for magician in magicians:    
  print(magician)
```

### Making Numerical Lists

#### Using the range() Function

Python’s `range()` function makes it easy to generate a series of numbers.

```py
for value in range(1, 5):    
  print(value)
```

In this example, `range()` prints only the numbers 1 through 4. This is another result of the **off-by-one** behavior you’ll see often in programming languages.

You can also pass `range()` only one argument, and it will start the sequence of numbers at 0. For example, `range(6)` would return the numbers from 0 through 5.

#### Using range() to Make a List of Numbers

In the example in the previous section, we simply printed out a series of numbers. We can use list() to convert that same set of numbers into a list:

```py
numbers = list(range(1, 6)) 
print(numbers)
```

We can also use the `range()` function to tell Python to skip numbers in a given range. If you pass a third argument to `range()`, Python uses that value as a step size when generating numbers. For example, here’s how to list the even numbers between 1 and 10:

```py
even_numbers = list(range(2, 11, 2)) 
print(even_numbers)
```

Here’s how you might put the first 10 square numbers into a list:

```py
squares = [] 
for value in range(1,11):   
  squares.append(value**2) 
  
print(squares)
```

#### Simple Statistics with a List of Numbers

```py
digits = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0]

min(digits) # 0 
max(digits) # 9 
sum(digits) # 45
```

#### List Comprehensions

```py
squares = [value**2 for value in range(1, 11)] 
print(squares)
```

### Working with Part of a List

#### Slicing a List

```py
players = ['charles', 'martina', 'michael', 'florence', 'eli'] 
print(players[1:4])
```

```py
players = ['charles', 'martina', 'michael', 'florence', 'eli'] 
print(players[:4])
```

```py
players = ['charles', 'martina', 'michael', 'florence', 'eli'] 
print(players[2:])
```

If we want to output the last three players on the roster, we can use the slice `players[-3:]`:

```py
players = ['charles', 'martina', 'michael', 'florence', 'eli'] 
print(players[-3:])
```

**Note**: You can include a third value in the brackets indicating a slice. If a third value is included, this tells Python how many items to skip between items in the specified range.

#### Looping Through a Slice

```py
players = ['charles', 'martina', 'michael', 'florence', 'eli'] 

print("Here are the first three players on my team:") 
for player in players[:3]:    
  print(player.title())
```

#### Copying a List

```py
my_foods = ['pizza', 'falafel', 'carrot cake'] 
friend_foods = my_foods[:]  # New

my_foods.append('cannoli') 
friend_foods.append('ice cream') 

print("My favorite foods are:") 
print(my_foods) 

print("\nMy friend's favorite foods are:") 
print(friend_foods)
```

### Tuples

However, sometimes you’ll want to create a list of items that **cannot change**. Tuples allow you to do just that. Python refers to values that cannot change as **immutable**, and an immutable list is called a **tuple**.

#### Defining a Tuple

```py
dimensions = (200, 50) 
print(dimensions[0]) 
print(dimensions[1])
```

**Note**: Tuples are technically defined by the presence of a **comma**; the parentheses make them look neater and more readable. If you want to define a tuple with one element, you need to include a **trailing comma**:   `my_t = (3,)`

#### Looping Through All Values in a Tuple

```py
dimensions = (200, 50) 
for dimension in dimensions:   
  print(dimension)
```

#### Writing Over a Tuple

```py
dimensions = (200, 50) 
print("Original dimensions:") 
for dimension in dimensions:  
  print(dimension) 
  
dimensions = (400, 100) 
print("\nModified dimensions:") 
for dimension in dimensions:   
  print(dimension)
```

## if Statements

#### Checking That a List Is Not Empty

When the name of a list is used in an `if` statement, Python returns `True` if the list contains at least one item; an empty list evaluates to `False`.

#### Using Multiple Lists

```py
available_toppings = ['mushrooms', 'olives', 'green peppers', 'pepperoni', 'pineapple', 'extra cheese'] 

requested_toppings = ['mushrooms', 'french fries', 'extra cheese'] 

for requested_topping in requested_toppings: 
  if requested_topping in available_toppings:   
    print(f"Adding {requested_topping}.") 
  else:     
    print(f"Sorry, we don't have {requested_topping}.") 
    
print("\nFinished making your pizza!")
```

## Dictionaries

### Working with Dictionaries

A **dictionary** in Python is a collection of **key-value pairs**. Each key is connected to a value, and you can use a key to access the value associated with that key.

#### Accessing Values in a Dictionary

```py
alien_0 = {'color': 'green'} 
print(alien_0['color'])
```

#### Adding New Key-Value Pairs

```py
alien_0 = {'color': 'green', 'points': 5} 
print(alien_0) 

alien_0['x_position'] = 0 
alien_0['y_position'] = 25 
print(alien_0)
```

#### Starting with an Empty Dictionary

```py
alien_0 = {} 

alien_0['color'] = 'green' 
alien_0['points'] = 5 

print(alien_0)
```

#### Removing Key-Value Pairs

```py
alien_0 = {'color': 'green', 'points': 5} 
print(alien_0) 

del alien_0['points'] 
print(alien_0)
```

#### Using get() to Access Values

For dictionaries specifically, you can use the `get()` method to set a default value that will be returned if the requested key doesn’t exist.

The `get()` method requires a key as a first argument. As a second optional argument, you can pass the value to be returned if the key doesn’t exist:

```py
alien_0 = {'color': 'green', 'speed': 'slow'} 

point_value = alien_0.get('points', 'No point value assigned.') 
print(point_value)
```

So, if there’s a chance the key you’re asking for might not exist, consider using the `get()` method instead of the square bracket notation.

**Note**: If you leave out the second argument in the call to `get()` and the key doesn’t exist, Python will return the value `None`. The special value `None` means “no value exists.” This is not an error: it’s a special value meant to indicate the **absence of a value**.

### Looping Through a Dictionary

#### Looping Through All Key-Value Pairs

```py
user_0 = {   
  'username': 'efermi',   
  'first': 'enrico',  
  'last': 'fermi',    
}

for key, value in user_0.items():  
  print(f"\nKey: {key}")  
  print(f"Value: {value}")
```

The second half of the `for` statement includes the name of the dictionary followed by the method `items()`, which returns a sequence of **key-value pairs**.

#### Looping Through All the Keys in a Dictionary

```py
favorite_languages = {  
  'jen': 'python', 
  'sarah': 'c',   
  'edward': 'rust',   
  'phil': 'python',   
}

for name in favorite_languages.keys():  
  print(name.title())
```

Looping through the keys is actually the default behavior when looping through a dictionary, so this code would have exactly the same output if you wrote:

```py
for name in favorite_languages:
```

#### Looping Through a Dictionary’s Keys in a Particular Order

You can use the `sorted()` function to get a copy of the keys in order:

```py
favorite_languages = {   
  'jen': 'python',  
  'sarah': 'c',   
  'edward': 'rust',   
  'phil': 'python',   
}

for name in sorted(favorite_languages.keys()): 
  print(f"{name.title()}, thank you for taking the poll.")
```

#### Looping Through All Values in a Dictionary

```py
favorite_languages = {   
  'jen': 'python',  
  'sarah': 'c',   
  'edward': 'rust', 
  'phil': 'python', 
}

print("The following languages have been mentioned:") 
for language in favorite_languages.values(): 
  print(language.title())
```

To see each language chosen without repetition, we can use a set. A **set** is a collection in which each item must be unique:

```py
favorite_languages = {   
  --snip-   
}

print("The following languages have been mentioned:") 
for language in set(favorite_languages.values()):  # New
  print(language.title())
```

You can build a **set** directly using braces and separating the elements with commas:

```py
>>> languages = {'python', 'rust', 'python', 'c'} 
>>> languages 
{'rust', 'python', 'c'}
```

It’s easy to mistake sets for dictionaries because they’re both wrapped in braces.  When you see braces but no key-value pairs, you’re probably looking at a set. Unlike lists and dictionaries, **sets do not retain items in any specific order**.

### Nesting

#### A List of Dictionaries

```py
alien_0 = {'color': 'green', 'points': 5} 
alien_1 = {'color': 'yellow', 'points': 10} 
alien_2 = {'color': 'red', 'points': 15} 

aliens = [alien_0, alien_1, alien_2] 

for alien in aliens:   
  print(alien)
```

#### A List in a Dictionary

```py
favorite_languages = {   
  'jen': ['python', 'rust'],  
  'sarah': ['c'],   
  'edward': ['rust', 'go'],  
  'phil': ['python', 'haskell'],   
} 

for name, languages in favorite_languages.items():   
  print(f"\n{name.title()}'s favorite languages are:") 
  for language in languages:       
    print(f"\t{language.title()}")
```

#### A Dictionary in a Dictionary

```py
users = {   
  'aeinstein': {   
    'first': 'albert',    
    'last': 'einstein',     
    'location': 'princeton',    
  },   
  'mcurie': {   
    'first': 'marie',     
    'last': 'curie',   
    'location': 'paris',   
  },  
} 

for username, user_info in users.items(): 
  print(f"\nUsername: {username}") 
  full_name = f"{user_info['first']} {user_info['last']}" 
  location = user_info['location'] 
  
  print(f"\tFull name: {full_name.title()}")  
  print(f"\tLocation: {location.title()}")
```

## User Input and while loops

### How the input() Function Works

#### Writing Clear Prompts

```py
name = input("Please enter your name: ") 
print(f"\nHello, {name}!")
```

#### Using int() to Accept Numerical Input

```py
height = input("How tall are you, in inches? ") 
height = int(height) 

if height >= 48:    
  print("\nYou're tall enough to ride!") 
else:  
  print("\nYou'll be able to ride when you're a little older.")
```

### Introducing while Loops

#### Removing All Instances of Specific Values from a List

```py
pets = ['dog', 'cat', 'dog', 'goldfish', 'cat', 'rabbit', 'cat'] 
print(pets) 

while 'cat' in pets:   
  pets.remove('cat') 
  
print(pets)
```

#### Filling a Dictionary with User Input

```py
responses = {} 
# Set a flag to indicate that polling is active.
polling_active = True 

while polling_active:    
  # Prompt for the person's name and response.
  name = input("\nWhat is your name? ")   
  response = input("Which mountain would you like to climb someday? ")   
  
  # Store the response in the dictionary.
  responses[name] = response   
  
  # Find out if anyone else is going to take the poll.
  repeat = input("Would you like to let another person respond? (yes/ no) ")   
  if repeat == 'no':     
    polling_active = False 
    
# Polling is complete. Show the results.
print("\n--- Poll Results ---") 
for name, response in responses.items():   
  print(f"{name} would like to climb {response}.")
```

## Functions

### Passing Arguments

#### Keyword Arguments

A keyword argument is a name-value pair that you pass to a function. You directly associate the name and the value within the argument, so when you pass the argument to the function, there’s no confusion.

```py
def describe_pet(animal_type, pet_name):   
  """Display information about a pet."""   
  print(f"\nI have a {animal_type}.")   
  print(f"My {animal_type}'s name is {pet_name.title()}.") 
  
describe_pet(animal_type='hamster', pet_name='harry')
```

The order of keyword arguments doesn’t matter because Python knows where each value should go.

#### Default Values

```py
def describe_pet(pet_name, animal_type='dog'):  
  """Display information about a pet."""   
  print(f"\nI have a {animal_type}.")  
  print(f"My {animal_type}'s name is {pet_name.title()}.") 
  
describe_pet(pet_name='willie')
```

**Note**: When you use default values, any parameter with a default value needs to be listed after all the parameters that don’t have default values.

### Passing an Arbitrary Number of Arguments

```py
def make_pizza(*toppings):   
  """Print the list of toppings that have been requested."""  
  print(toppings) 
  
make_pizza('pepperoni') 
make_pizza('mushrooms', 'green peppers', 'extra cheese')

# ('pepperoni',)
# ('mushrooms', 'green peppers', 'extra cheese')
```

The asterisk in the parameter name *toppings tells Python to make a tuple called toppings, containing all the values this function receives. Note that Python packs the arguments into a tuple, even if the function receives only one value.

#### Mixing Positional and Arbitrary Arguments

```py
def make_pizza(size, *toppings):   
  """Summarize the pizza we are about to make."""  
  print(f"\nMaking a {size}-inch pizza with the following toppings:")  
  for topping in toppings:     
    print(f"- {topping}") 
    
make_pizza(16, 'pepperoni') 
make_pizza(12, 'mushrooms', 'green peppers', 'extra cheese')
```

#### Using Arbitrary Keyword Arguments

```py
def build_profile(first, last, **user_info):  
  """Build a dictionary containing everything we know about a user.""" 
  user_info['first_name'] = first   
  user_info['last_name'] = last   
  return user_info 

user_profile = build_profile('albert', 'einstein', location='princeton', field='physics') 
print(user_profile)
```

The definition of `build_profile()` expects a first and last name, and then it allows the user to pass in as many name-value pairs as they want. The double asterisks before the parameter `**user_info` cause Python to create a dictionary called `user_info` containing all the extra name-value pairs the function receives. Within the function, you can access the key-value pairs in `user_info` just as you would for any dictionary.

### Storing Your Functions in Modules

#### Importing an Entire Module

```py
# pizza.py

def make_pizza(size, *toppings):   
  """Summarize the pizza we are about to make."""   
  print(f"\nMaking a {size}-inch pizza with the following toppings:")  
  for topping in toppings:    
    print(f"- {topping}")
```

```py
# making_pizzas.py

import pizza 

pizza.make_pizza(16, 'pepperoni')
pizza.make_pizza(12, 'mushrooms', 'green peppers', 'extra cheese')
```

#### Importing Specific Functions

You can also import a specific function from a module. Here’s the general syntax for this approach:

```py
from module_name import function_name
```

You can import as many functions as you want from a module by separating each function’s name with a comma:

```py
from module_name import function_0, function_1, function_2
```

The `making_pizzas.py` example would look like this if we want to import just the function we’re going to use:

```py
from pizza import make_pizza 

make_pizza(16, 'pepperoni') 
make_pizza(12, 'mushrooms', 'green peppers', 'extra cheese')
```

#### Using as to Give a Function an Alias

```py
from pizza import make_pizza as mp 

mp(16, 'pepperoni') 
mp(12, 'mushrooms', 'green peppers', 'extra cheese')
```

The general syntax for providing an alias is:

```py
from module_name import function_name as fn
```

#### Using as to Give a Module an Alias

```py
import pizza as p 

p.make_pizza(16, 'pepperoni') 
p.make_pizza(12, 'mushrooms', 'green peppers', 'extra cheese')
```

The general syntax for this approach is:

```py
import module_name as mn
```

#### Importing All Functions in a Module

You can tell Python to import every function in a module by using the asterisk (*) operator:

```py
from pizza import * 

make_pizza(16, 'pepperoni') 
make_pizza(12, 'mushrooms', 'green peppers', 'extra cheese')
```

The asterisk in the import statement tells Python to copy every function from the module pizza into this program file. Because every function is imported, you can call each function by name without using the dot notation. 

However, it’s best not to use this approach when you’re working with larger modules that you didn’t write: if the module has a function name that matches an existing name in your project, you can get unexpected results.

## Classes
