> Dear Smith,
>
> I just got back from my trip and wanted to take a moment to thank you for the huge favour you did for me while I was away on my business trip to Marseille last week. Knowing that you were taking care of my apartment—and especially looking after Lily, my lovely cat—made all the difference and gave me such peace of mind.
>
> You truly went above and beyond – not just feeding her and cleaning her litter box, but also sending me those daily photo updates and spending time playing with her favourite feather toy. You know how anxious she usually gets when I'm away, but your regular visits kept her happy and calm. When I got home, she was so relaxed and well-cared for, which means the world to me.
>
> I'd love to show my appreciation by having you over for dinner this weekend. I brought back some amazing French wines and local specialities that I think you'll enjoy. Plus, I'm sure Lily would love to see her favourite cat-sitter again! Please let me know if Saturday evening works for you.
>
> Thanks again for being such a wonderful friend.

> Best wishes,
