> Dear Mr. Wilson,
>
> I am writing regarding the "Digital Marketing Fundamentals" course that I attended at Greenwich College on October 20th. I was one of thirty participants who paid Â£200 for this one-day intensive course.
>
> Unfortunately, I must express my disappointment with several aspects of the course. While the course description promised hands-on training in social media marketing, SEO, and content creation, the entire day was spent merely listening to theoretical lectures. The instructor, though knowledgeable, rushed through the content without allowing time for practical exercises or questions. Furthermore, the computer lab that was advertised as part of the course was unavailable due to technical issues.
>
> To improve future courses, I would like to suggest a few adjustments. Firstly, reducing the class size would allow for more individual attention and better engagement. Secondly, structuring the course to balance both theory and practical sessions, as advertised, would enhance learning. Lastly, providing detailed course materials and resources for participants to reference after the course would offer more long-term value.
>
> Thank you for considering these suggestions. I hope they contribute to an improved experience for future attendees.
>
> Yours sincerely,
>
