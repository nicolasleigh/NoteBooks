> Dear Sir/Madam,
>
> I am writing to express my deep concern regarding the escalating waste management issue on Greenwood Street, where I have resided for the past five years.
>
> Over recent months, the situation has become particularly alarming. Overflowing dustbins, scattered plastic waste, and uncollected garbage bags are now common sights along our street. The designated collection point at the corner of Greenwood Street has turned into an unofficial dumping ground, with waste often left uncollected for days.
>
> This negligence poses serious health and environmental risks to our community. The accumulated waste has started attracting pests and stray animals, creating unsanitary conditions. After recent rains, the litter blocked several drainage points, causing waterlogging on the street. Moreover, the foul odour has made it unpleasant for residents to even open their windows, and children can no longer play safely in the neighbourhood park.
>
> I would like to suggest several measures that could help address this issue effectively. Firstly, increasing the frequency of waste collection from twice to at least four times a week would help prevent bin overflow. Secondly, adding more covered waste bins along the street would discourage littering. Finally, implementing a strict fine system for those who dump garbage inappropriately could serve as an effective deterrent.
>
> I look forward to your prompt action on this matter.
>
> Yours faithfully,
>
> Nicolas Leigh
