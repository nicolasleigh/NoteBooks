You are due to move into a rented apartment next month but you will not be able to because you have some problems. Write a letter to the landlord. In your letter: 

- explain your situation 
- describe your problems 
- tell him/her when you think you can move in

> Dear Mr. Chen,
>
> I am writing to inform you of a delay in my plans to move into the apartment at 45 Park Street on November 1st.  Unfortunately, I need to request a short delay to my move-in date due to an unexpected accident.
>
> Yesterday, I slipped and broke my wrist, which has been put in a cast. This injury makes it impossible for me to pack my belongings and manage the move as planned. Although my family has offered to help, they won't be able to travel here until mid-November due to their work commitments.
>
> Given this situation, I would greatly appreciate it if I could move in on November 15th instead of November 1st. I completely understand this is a change to our agreement, and I am more than willing to pay the full month's rent for November to secure the apartment. I can transfer the payment on the originally agreed date of November 1st.
>
> Please let me know if this arrangement would be acceptable. I am also happy to provide medical documentation of my injury if needed.
>
> Yours sincerely,
>
> Nicolas Leigh
