> Dear Mr. Wilson,
>
> I am writing to sincerely apologize for my absence from the Annual Company Meeting held on December 21st. I understand that this event is one of the most important gatherings of the year, providing valuable insights into our companyâ€™s goals and accomplishments, as well as an opportunity to connect with colleagues and leadership.

> Unfortunately, I was involved in a minor car accident on my way to the event. While I wasn't seriously injured, I needed to spend several hours at the emergency department for precautionary checks and to complete necessary insurance documentation. I tried to relay a message through my colleague, Sarah Chen, but I understand that it may not have reached you in time.
>
> I have already reached out to a few colleagues to gather notes and updates from the meeting, and I would be grateful for any additional resources or insights you might recommend so I can fully catch up on what I missed. Again, I apologize for not being present, and I appreciate your understanding.

> Best regards,
