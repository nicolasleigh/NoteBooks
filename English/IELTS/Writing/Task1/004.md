> Dear Sarah, 
>
> I just heard about the loss of Max, and I wanted to reach out to let you know how sorry I am. Losing a pet who's been such a faithful companion for twelve years is truly heartbreaking, and my heart goes out to you during this difficult time. 
>
> Max was such a special golden retriever. I'll never forget how he would greet me with his favourite tennis ball, tail wagging with endless enthusiasm, whenever I visited. His gentle nature and the way he would rest his head on your lap during our coffee chats made him such a wonderful presence in your home. 
>
> In the coming days, please remember that you’re not alone. I’m here for you anytime you need to talk or just want someone to keep you company. Maybe we could go for a walk or spend a quiet evening together to relax. I hope knowing you’re surrounded by people who care will bring you some comfort.

> With all my sympathy,
>
