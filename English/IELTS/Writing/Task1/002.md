You are travelling and need someone to do you a favour while you are gone. Write a letter asking a neighbour or friend for help. In your letter include:  

- where you are going 
- what the favour is 
- why you need this friend to help

> Dear Smith,
>
> I hope you’re doing well! I’m writing to ask for a small favour while I’m away on a business trip. I’ll be travelling to Marseille, France, for one week, from November 1 to November 7.
>
> While I’m away, could you please check on my apartment every few days? Mainly, I need someone to make sure my cat, Lily, is alright. Although I've left enough food and water for her, I'm still a bit worried. I’d feel much more comfortable knowing someone is keeping an eye on her while I'm away.
>
> I thought of asking you because you live nearby, and Lily is fond of you. I know I can trust you to handle things if there’s an unexpected issue. Of course, I’ll bring back something from France as a thank-you gift!
>
> Let me know if you’re available; if so, I’ll arrange a time to drop by and leave a spare key before I set off.
>
> Thanks so much!
>
> Best regards,
>
> Nicolas Leigh
