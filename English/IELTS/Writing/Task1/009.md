Your friend invited you to his/her birthday party, but you were unable to attend. Write a letter apologizing for your absence. In your letter: 

- state why you could not go 
- explain your reason for not contacting your friend sooner 
- suggest another time to meet

> Dear Sarah,
>
> I'm so sorry I couldn't make it to your 30th birthday celebration on Saturday night. I feel awful about missing such a special milestone, and even worse for not letting you know sooner.
>
> I came down with a nasty case of food poisoning on Saturday afternoon after having lunch at that new café downtown. It hit me so suddenly that I spent most of the evening in the bathroom, and honestly, I was too ill to even reach for my phone. By the time I started feeling better on Sunday, I felt terrible for not contacting you earlier—I hope my absence didn’t affect your special day.
>
> I'd love to make it up to you! How about I treat you to dinner at that Italian place you've been wanting to try? I'm free any evening next week, and I promise to stay away from questionable cafés beforehand! I also have a birthday gift for you that I think you're going to love.
>
> Please let me know what day works best for you. And again, I'm really sorry for both missing your party and not getting in touch sooner.
>
> Hope to see you soon,
>
> Nicolas Leigh
