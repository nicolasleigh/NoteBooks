Write a letter of complaint to a company outlining a problem you had while visiting one of their stores. In your letter include:

- what you want to happen as a result of your letter

> Dear Sir/Madam, 
>
> I am writing to express my dissatisfaction regarding my recent experience at your Oxford Street store on 15th October 2024. 
>
> While shopping for a new laptop, I was left waiting at the electronics counter for over 45 minutes despite being the only customer. Despite pressing the assistance button several times, no staff member attended to me, and when I finally located an employee, they appeared disinterested and provided incorrect information about your product warranty policy. 
>
> This experience was particularly upsetting as I had specifically taken time off from work to make this purchase and had travelled over an hour to visit your store based on your reputation for excellent customer service. Moreover, the incorrect information I received from your employee could have led to a significant financial mistake on my part. 
>
> I would appreciate a formal explanation for this lapse in service and request that your staff receive additional training in customer service and product knowledge. Additionally, I would like to know your actual warranty policy for laptops to ensure I have the correct information for future reference. 
>
> I look forward to your response within the next ten working days. 
>
> Yours faithfully, 
>
> Nicolas Leigh
