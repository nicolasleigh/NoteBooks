> Dear Sarah,
>
> I just got back from my holiday, and I wanted to tell you how amazing the trip was! The weather was perfect, and I got to see so many incredible sights and try some delicious local foods. Thank you so much for lending me the guidebook—it made a huge difference in my experience.
>
> The guidebook was especially helpful in showing me some lesser-known places to visit. I ended up exploring a few hidden spots that weren’t crowded with tourists, thanks to the tips in the book. The maps and restaurant recommendations were spot-on too; I never would have found that cozy café without it!
>
> I’ll drop by to return the guidebook this weekend if that’s convenient for you, or I can leave it in your mailbox if you’re not home. Thanks again for your help—I couldn’t have had such a great trip without it!
>
> Best wishes,
>
