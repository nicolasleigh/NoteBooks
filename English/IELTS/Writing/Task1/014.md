> Dear Sir/Madam,
>
> I am writing to express my disappointment regarding a delay on my recent train journey, which resulted in my missing an important interview in Manchester. I travelled on Train No. 102 on October 15th, with a scheduled departure time of 7:00 AM. However, the train was delayed by over two hours due to technical issues.
>
> Due to this delay, I was unable to reach my interview on time. Although I informed the hiring manager about the situation while on the train, they could not reschedule my interview for the same day due to a tight schedule. This delay has potentially cost me a valuable career opportunity, as I was among the final candidates for the position.
>
> This experience has been extremely distressing, especially as there was no prior notification about the delay, nor any arrangement for an alternative means of travel. As a regular passenger who relies on railway services for crucial commitments, I believe more effective communication and contingency plans are necessary in such cases to assist passengers in managing unexpected delays.
>
> Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to any steps the railway service might consider to improve reliability for its passengers.
>
> Yours faithfully,
>
> Nicolas Leigh
