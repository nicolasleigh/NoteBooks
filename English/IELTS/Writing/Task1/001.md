Write a letter to a company asking for a refund for something you bought from them online. In your letter include: 

- what you bought 
- what the problem is  
- why you want a refund

> Dear Customer Service Team,
>
> I am writing to request a refund for a recent purchase I made through your online store on November 17. I ordered a model T35 Bluetooth earphone, which was advertised as having high-quality sound and a 10-hour battery life.
>
> Unfortunately, when the item arrived, it did not meet these expectations. The earphone has several issues: the battery only lasts around one hour on a full charge, and the sound quality is distorted, particularly at higher volumes. I have tried troubleshooting according to the product manuals, but the issues persist, suggesting a defect with the product itself.
>
> Given that the item is not functioning as advertised, I would appreciate a full refund. I believe this is reasonable, considering the inconvenience and the fact that the product does not meet the specifications outlined in your shop.
>
> Please let me know if you require any additional information to process the refund. I have attached a copy of the receipt for reference. Thank you for your attention to this matter, and I look forward to resolving it promptly.
>
> Sincerely,
>
> Nicolas Leigh
