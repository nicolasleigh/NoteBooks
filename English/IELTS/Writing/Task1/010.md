Something in an airport delayed you and you missed your flight. Write a letter to the airport's customer service department. In your letter include: 

- what delayed you  
- how missing this flight affected you 
- what you would like the airport to do about this issue

> Dear Sir/Madam,
>
> I am writing to express my concerns about a delay I experienced on October 22nd, which caused me to miss my flight, BA173, to New York. I hope my feedback can help prevent similar issues for other travellers in the future.
>
> On the day of my departure, I was delayed for over an hour at the security checkpoint due to a combination of understaffing and malfunctioning equipment. Despite arriving at the airport well in advance, the unusually long wait prevented me from reaching my gate on time, resulting in missing my flight. Unfortunately, this delay significantly disrupted my travel plans, as I was unable to attend an important meeting scheduled for that evening.
>
> I would appreciate it if the airport could consider implementing measures to reduce wait times at security. Adding more staff during peak hours or conducting regular maintenance on equipment to avoid malfunctions could greatly improve the efficiency of the security process. Additionally, a voucher or partial reimbursement for the missed flight would be appreciated, as this delay was due to circumstances beyond my control.
>
> Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to any updates on how these issues might be addressed.
>
> Yours faithfully,
>
> Nicolas Leigh
