You are a student at an English language school in Brighton and are living in private accommodation with other flatmates. You have not had hot water or heating for some time. The landlordâ€™s workmen have tried to fix the problem but without success. Write a letter to the landlord. In your letter: 

- state your reason for writing 
- describe the problems and explain how you feel 
- propose a solution and risk the landlord to take action

> Dear Mr. Wilson,
>
> I am one of the tenants at your property at 23 Maple Street, Flat 2B, and I am writing to address the ongoing issue with the hot water supply.
>
> Since moving in this September, we have always paid our rent on time. However, we have now been without hot water for over two weeks, which has made daily life increasingly difficult, especially as the weather turns colder. Last week, you mentioned that a workman would arrive within three days, but unfortunately, no one came. After numerous follow-up calls, the workman arrived five days later, only to inform us that the boiler was too old to repair. This outcome has left us extremely dissatisfied.
>
> We are committed to continuing renting, but we ask that you arrange for emergency repairs to restore the hot water. Given the inconvenience caused, we also request a 40% rent discount for the period we have been without this essential service.
>
> Thank you for your attention to this matter. We look forward to your prompt response.
>
> Sincerely,
>
> Nicolas Leigh
