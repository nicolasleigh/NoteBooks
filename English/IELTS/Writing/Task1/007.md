Write a letter to your local library suggesting something they could do to improve their facility. In your letter include: 

- a recount of a poor experience you had 
- what you feel the library should change 
- why you feel the library needs alteration 

> Dear Sir/Madam,
>
> I am a regular visitor to our local library, and I wanted to offer a suggestion that I believe could enhance the experience for all patrons.
>
> During a recent visit, I attempted to complete some important work in the library's main study space. However, I found it extremely difficult to concentrate due to the noise level. A group of students at the shared study table was having a loud discussion about their project, while several other patrons were holding phone conversations. Despite the "Quiet Study Area" signs, there seemed to be no enforcement of noise regulations.
>
> I believe the library would benefit greatly from creating separate zones for different types of study. Specifically, I suggest designating the current main study area as a strict silent zone while converting the unused room on the ground floor into a collaborative space where groups can work together and have discussions.
>
> This change would significantly improve the library's functionality for all users. Students who need to work in groups would have a dedicated space for collaboration, while individuals requiring silence for concentrated work would have a genuinely quiet environment. This adjustment would make our library more inclusive and better suited to the diverse needs of our community.
>
> I look forward to hearing your thoughts on this suggestion.
>
> Yours faithfully,
>
> Nicolas Leigh
