## 3 progressive structures

### 1 construction

Progressive verb structures (also called ‘continuous’) are made with ***be + -ing.***

> I ***am waiting*** for the shops to open. (present progressive) 
>
> Your suit ***is being cleaned***. (present progressive passive) 
>
> She phoned while ***I was cooking***. (past progressive) 
>
> ***Will*** you ***be going*** out this evening? (future progressive) 
>
> I'd like ***to be lying*** on the beach now. (progressive infinitive) 

Progressive and perfect forms can be combined.

> I didn't know how long she ***had been sitting*** there. (past perfect progressive) 

### 2 terminology and use 

A progressive does not simply show the time of an event. It also shows how the speaker sees the event - generally as ongoing and temporary, not completed or permanent. (Because of this, grammars often talk about 'progressive aspect’ rather than 'progressive tenses’.) Compare: 

> I'***ve read*** your email. (completed action) 
>
> I’***ve been reading*** a lot of thrillers recently. (not necessarily completed) 
>
> The Rhine ***runs*** into the North Sea. (permanent) 
>
> We’ll have to phone the plumber - water'***s running*** down the kitchen wall. (temporary) 

When a progressive is used to refer to a short momentary action, it often suggests repetition.

> Why ***are*** you ***jumping*** up and down? 
>
> The door ***was banging*** in the wind.

### 3 distancing:  I  was wondering ...

Progressives can make requests, questions and statements less direct.

They sound less definite than simple forms, because they suggest something temporary and incomplete.

> I’***m hoping*** you can lend me £10. (less definite than I hope . . .) 
>
> What time ***are*** you ***planning*** to arrive? 
>
> I'***m looking*** forward to seeing you again.
>
> I'm afraid we must ***be going***.
>
> I ***was wondering*** if you had two single rooms.
>
> Will you ***be going*** away at the weekend?

## 4 non-progressive verbs

### 1 verbs not often used in progressive ( ' continuous' )  forms 

Some verbs are not often used in progressive forms.

> I ***like*** this music. ( not ~~I’m liking this music.~~) 
>
> I called her because I ***needed*** to talk, ( not  . . . because I ~~was needing~~ to talk.) 

Some other verbs are not used in progressive forms when they have certain meanings (see below). Compare: 

> I'***m seeing*** the doctor at ten o'clock.
>
> I ***see*** what you mean, (not ~~I’m seeing what you mean~~.) 

Many of these non-progressive verbs refer to states rather than actions. Some refer to mental states (e.g. know, think, believe); some others refer to the use of the senses (e.g. smell, taste).

Modal verbs (e.g. can, must) have no progressive forms.

### 2 common non-progressive verbs

### 3 progressive and non-progressive uses 

> I’***m feeling*** fine, ( or  I ***feel*** fine.) 
>
> I ***feel*** we shouldn't do it. ( not  ~~I’m feeling we shouldn't do it.~~ - feel here = have an opinion.)  
>
> What ***are*** you ***thinking*** about? 
>
> What ***do*** you ***think*** of the government? (not ~~What are you thinking of the government?~~ - think here = have an opinion.)  
>

>
> The scales broke when I ***was weighing*** myself this morning.
>
> I ***weighed*** 68 kilos three months ago - and look at me now! ( not ~~I was weighing 68 kilos~~ . . . - weigh here = have weight.) 

Occasionally 'non-progressive’ verbs are used in progressive forms in order to emphasise the idea of change or development.

> These days, more and more people ***prefer*** / ***are preferring*** to retire early.
>
> The water ***tastes*** /  ***is tasting*** better today.
>
> As I get older, I ***remember*** /  I’***m remembering*** less and less.
>
> I'***m liking*** it here more and more as time goes by.

*Need*, *want* and *mean* can have future or present perfect progressive uses.

> ***Will*** you ***be needing*** the car this afternoon? 
>
> I’***ve been wanting*** to go to Australia for years.
>
> I’***ve been meaning*** to tell you about Andrew. He ...

### 4 can see,  etc 

*Can* is often used with *see*, *hear*, *feel*, *taste*, *smell*, *understand* and *remember* to give a kind of progressive meaning, especially in British English.

> I ***can see*** Emma coming down the road.
>
> ***Can*** you ***smell*** something burning? 

### 5 -ing forms 

Even verbs which are never used in progressive tenses have -ing forms which can be used in other kinds of structure.

> ***Knowing*** her tastes, I bought her a large box of chocolates.
>
> You can respect people’s views without ***agreeing*** with them.

## 5 progressive with always,  etc 

We can use *always*, *continually* and similar words with a progressive form to mean ‘very often’.

> I’***m always losing*** my keys. 
>
> Granny’***s always giving*** people little presents. 
>
> I’***m continually running*** into Oliver these days.
>
> That cat'***s forever getting*** shut in the bathroom.

This structure is used to talk about things which happen very often (perhaps more often than expected), and which are unexpected or unplanned. Compare: 

> When Alice comes to see me, I ***always meet*** her at the station. (a regular, planned arrangement) 
>
> I’***m always meeting*** Mrs Bailiff in the supermarket. (accidental, unplanned meetings) 
>
> When I was a child, we ***always had*** picnics on Saturdays in the summer. (regular, planned) 
>
> Her mother ***was always arranging*** little surprise picnics and outings. (unexpected, not regular) 

The structure is often used in critical remarks.

> He'***s always scratching*** himself in public.

## 6 perfect structures 

### 1 construction 

Perfect verb forms are made with **have + past participle**.

> She ***has lost*** her memory. (present perfect) 
>
> I told him that I ***had*** never ***heard*** of the place. (past perfect) 
>
> When I went back to the village the house ***had been pulled*** down. (past perfect passive) 
>
> We ***will have finished*** by tomorrow afternoon. (future perfect tense) 
>
> I'm sorry ***to have disturbed*** you. (perfect infinitive) 
>
> ***Having seen*** the film, I don't want to read the book. (perfect -ing form) 

Perfect and progressive forms can be combined.

> They ***have been living*** in Portugal for the last year. (present perfect progressive)

### 2 terminology and use 

A perfect verb form generally shows the time of an event as being earlier than some other time (past, present or future). But a perfect does not only show the time of an event. It also shows how the speaker sees the event -  perhaps as being connected to a later event, or as being completed by a certain time. Because of this, academic grammars often talk about ‘perfect aspect' rather than 'perfect tenses’.

## 7 subjects, objects and complements 

### 1 subjects 

The **subject** of a verb is a noun phrase, noun or pronoun that comes before it in a statement. Often the subject indicates the **agent** -  the person or thing that causes the action of the verb.

> ***My brother*** gave me this. 
>
> ***Rain*** stopped play. 
>
> ***You*** woke me up.

But the subject can also, for example, indicate the receiver or experiencer of an action -  it depends on the verb.

> All the soldiers ***got*** medals. 
>
> I ***saw*** the accident.

Subjects cannot normally be dropped.

> not ~~He has changed his plans; will arrive tomorrow.~~
>
> not ~~Is raining.~~

For special structures in which it is possible to drop subjects, ► 224, 275.

### 2 transitive and intransitive verbs 

Some verbs are usually followed by nouns, noun phrases or pronouns that act as **direct objects**. These typically show who or what is affected by the action of the verb. In grammars they are called 'transitive'. Examples are *invite*, *surprise*.

> Let's ***invite Sophie and Bruce***. ( but not ~~Let’s invite.~~) 
>
> You ***surprised me***. (but not ~~You surprised.~~) 

Some verbs are not normally followed by direct objects. These are called 'intransitive'. Examples are *sit*, *sleep*.

> Do ***sit*** down, ( but not ~~Do sit that chair~~.) 
>
> I usually ***sleep*** well, ( but not ~~She slept the baby~~.) 

Many verbs can be both transitive and intransitive. Compare: 

> England ***lost the match***. 
>
> England ***lost***. 
>
> I can’t ***eat this***.
>
> Let’s ***eat***.

Some transitive verbs can be followed by two objects (indirect and direct). For details, ► 8.

> I'll ***send you the form*** tomorrow. 
>
> I’m going to ***buy Sarah some flowers***. 

Some verbs are used transitively and intransitively with different kinds of subject; the intransitive use has a meaning rather like a passive (► 9) or reflexive (► 178) verb. Compare: 

> She ***opened the door.*** 
>
> The door ***opened***. 
>
> The wind's ***moving the curtain***.
>
> The curtain’s ***moving***.

Some transitive verbs can be followed by an object together with an object complement (an expression that gives more information about the object). For details, ► 10.

> You ***make me nervous***. 
>
> Let’s ***paint it blue***.

### 3 complements of place 

Usually, a preposition is necessary before an expression of place.

> She ***arrived at the station*** last night. (not ~~She arrived the station~~. . .) 
>
> Don’t ***walk on the grass***. ( not ~~Don’t walk the grass~~.) 

A few verbs can be used with direct objects referring to place.

> I like ***climbing mountains***. ( not ~~I like climbing on mountains~~.) 

Some verbs are incomplete without an expression of place.

> He ***lives in York***. (but not ~~He lives~~.) 

### 4 linking verbs 

Some verbs are followed not by an object, but by a subject complement - an expression which describes the subject. These are called ‘linking verbs’. For details, ► 11.

> Your room ***is a mess***. 
>
> The bathroom ***is upstairs***.
>
> That ***looks nice***. 
>
> I ***felt a complete idiot***.
