### Murder Your Darlings - Confirmation Bias (Part 2)

In the previous chapter, we met the father of all fallacies, the confirmation bias. Here are a few examples of it: We are forced to establish beliefs about the world, our lives, the economy, investments, our careers, and more. We deal mostly in assumptions, and the more **nebulous** these are, the stronger the confirmation bias. Whether you go through life believing that “people are **inherently** good” or “people are inherently bad,” you will find daily proof to support your case. Both parties, the **philanthropists** and the **misanthropes**, simply filter disconfirming evidence (evidence to the contrary) and focus on the **do-gooders** and **dictators** who support their worldviews.

**Astrologers** and economists operate on the same principle. They utter **prophecies** so vague that any event can **substantiate** them: “In the coming weeks you will experience sadness,” or “In the medium term, the pressure on the dollar will increase.” But what is the medium term? What will cause the dollar to **depreciate**? And depreciation measured against what—gold, yen, pesos, wheat, residential property in Manhattan, the average price of a hot dog?

Religious and **philosophical** beliefs represent an excellent breeding ground for the confirmation bias. Here, in soft, **spongy** **terrain**, it grows wild and free. For example, **worshippers** always find evidence for God’s existence, even though he never shows himself **overtly**—except to illiterates in the desert and in isolated mountain villages. It is never to **the masses** in, say, Frankfurt or New York. Counterarguments are dismissed by the faithful, demonstrating just how powerful the confirmation bias is.

> [philosophical](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english-chinese-traditional/philosophical): relating to the study or writing of philosophy
>
> [spongy](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english-chinese-traditional/spongy): soft and able to absorb or having already absorbed a lot of liquid, like a sponge

No professionals suffer more from the confirmation bias than business journalists. Often, they formulate an easy theory, pad it out with two or three pieces of “evidence,” and call it a day. For example: “Google is so successful because the company **nurtures** a culture of creativity.” Once this idea is on paper, the journalist **corroborates** it by mentioning a few other prosperous companies that **foster** **ingenuity**. Rarely does the writer seek out disconfirming evidence, which in this instance would be struggling businesses that **live and breathe** creativity or, **conversely**, flourishing firms that are utterly uncreative. Both groups have plenty of members, but the journalist simply ignores them. If he or she were to mention just one, the story line would be ruined.

> [nurture](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english-chinese-traditional/nurture?q=nurtures): to help a plan or a person to develop and be successful
>
> [corroborate](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english-chinese-traditional/corroborate?q=corroborates): to add proof to an account, statement, idea, etc. with new information
>
> [foster](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english-chinese-traditional/foster): to encourage the development or growth of ideas or feelings

> [conversely](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english-chinese-traditional/conversely): in an opposite way

Self-help and get-rich-quick books are further examples of **blinkered** storytelling. Their shrewd authors collect piles of proof to pump up the most **banal** of theories, such as “meditation is the key to happiness.” Any reader seeking disconfirming evidence does so in vain: Nowhere in these books do we see people who lead fulfilled lives without meditation, or those who, despite meditation, are still sad.

> [blinkered](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english-chinese-traditional/blinkered): A blinkered person is unable or unwilling to understand other people's beliefs, and blinkered opinions or ways of behaving show someone is unable or unwilling to understand other people.
>
> [banal](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english-chinese-traditional/banal): boring, ordinary, and not original

The Internet is particularly fertile ground for the confirmation bias. To stay **informed**, we browse news sites and blogs, forgetting that our favored pages mirror our existing values, be they **liberal**, **conservative**, or somewhere in between. Moreover, a lot of sites now **tailor** content to personal interests and browsing history, causing new and **divergent** opinions to vanish from the radar altogether. We inevitably land in communities of **like-minded** people, further reinforcing our convictions—and the confirmation bias.

> [informed](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/informed): having a lot of knowledge or information about something
>
> [liberal](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english-chinese-traditional/liberal): respecting and allowing many different types of beliefs or behaviour
>
> [conservative](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english-chinese-traditional/conservative): not usually liking or trusting change, especially sudden change
>
> [tailor](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/tailor): to make something specially so that it is right for a particular person, organization, or purpose
>
> [divergent](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english-chinese-traditional/divergent): different or becoming different from something else
>
> [like-minded](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/like-minded): People who are described as like-minded share the same opinions, ideas, or interests

Literary critic Arthur Quiller-Couch had a memorable motto: “Murder your darlings.” This was his advice to writers who struggled with cutting cherished but redundant sentences. Quiller-Couch’s appeal is not just for **hesitant** **hacks** but for all of us who suffer from the **deafening silence** of **assent**. To fight against the confirmation bias, try writing down your beliefs—whether in terms of worldview, investments, marriage, health care, diet, career strategies—and set out to find disconfirming evidence. **Axing** beliefs that feel like old friends is hard work but **imperative**.

> [hesitant](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english-chinese-traditional/hesitant): If you are hesitant, you do not do something immediately or quickly because you are nervous or not certain.
>
> [hack](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/hack): a journalist (= writer for newspapers or magazines) whose work is low in quality or does not have much imagination
>
> [deafening silence](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/deafening-silence): silence or lack of response, when people expect you to speak or act
>
> [assent](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english-chinese-traditional/assent): official agreement to or approval of an idea, plan, or request
>
