### Don’t Bow to Authority - Authority Bias

The first book of the Bible explains what happens when we disobey a great authority: We get ejected from paradise. This is also what less **celestial** authorities would have us believe—political pundits, scientists, doctors, CEOs, economists, government heads, sports commentators, consultants, and stock market gurus.

> [celestial](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english-chinese-traditional/celestial): of or from the sky or outside this world

Authorities pose two main problems to clear thinking: First, their **track records** are often **sobering**. There are about one million trained economists on the planet, and not one of them could accurately predict the timing of the 2008 financial crisis (with the exception of Nouriel Roubini and Nassim Taleb), let alone how the collapse would **play out**, from the real estate bubble bursting to credit **default** swaps collapsing, right through to the **full-blown** economic **crunch**. Never has a group of experts failed so **spectacularly**. The story from the medical world is much the same: Up until 1900 it was **discernibly** wiser for patients to avoid doctor’s visits; too often the “treatment” only worsened the illness, due to poor **hygiene** and folk practices such as **bloodletting**.

Psychologist Stanley Milgram demonstrated the authority bias most clearly in an experiment in 1961. His subjects were instructed to **administer** ever-increasing electrical shocks to a person sitting on the other side of a pane of glass. They were told to start with 15 volts, then 30 volts, 45 volts, and so on, until they reached the maximum—a **lethal** dose of 450 volts. In reality, no electrical current was actually flowing; Milgram used an actor to play the role of the victim, but those charged with administering the shocks didn’t know that. The results were, well, shocking: As the person in the other room **wailed** and **writhed** in pain, and the subject administering the shock wanted to stop, the professor would say, “Keep going, the experiment depends on it.” The majority of people continued with the **electrocution**. More than half of the participants went all the way up to the maximum voltage—out of sheer **obedience** to authority.

Over the past decade, **airlines** have also learned the dangers of the authority bias. In the old days, the captain was king. His commands were not to be doubted. If a **copilot** **suspected** an **oversight**, he wouldn’t have dared to address it out of respect for—or fear of—his captain. Since this behavior was discovered, nearly every airline has **instituted** crew resource management (CRM), which coaches pilots and their crews to discuss any **reservations** they have openly and quickly. In other words: They carefully deprogram the authority bias. CRM has contributed more to flight safety in the past twenty years than have any technical advances.

Many companies are **light-years** from this sort of **foresight**. Especially at risk are firms with **domineering** CEOs, where employees are likely to keep their “**lesser**” opinions to themselves—much to the **detriment** of the business.

Authorities **crave** **recognition** and constantly find ways to reinforce their status. Doctors and researchers **sport** white coats. Bank directors **don** suits and ties. Kings wear crowns. Members of the military **wield** rank badges. Today, even more symbols and props are used to signal expertise: appearances on talk shows and on the covers of magazines, to **book tours** and Wikipedia **entries**. Authority changes much like fashion does, and society follows it just as much.

In conclusion: Whenever you are about to make a decision, think about which authority figures might be **exerting** an influence on your reasoning. And when you encounter one in the flesh, do your best to challenge him or her.

> [exert](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english-chinese-traditional/exert?q=exerting): to use something such as authority, power, influence, etc. in order to make something happen
