### Why You Should Forget the Past - Sunk Cost Fallacy

The film was **dire**. After an hour, I whispered to my wife: “Come on, let’s go home.” She replied: “No way. We’re not throwing away thirty dollars.” “That’s no reason to stay,” I protested. “The money’s already gone. This is the sunk cost fallacy at work—a thinking error!” She glared at me as if she had just bitten off a piece of lemon. Okay, I sometimes **go overboard** on the subject, itself an error called déformation professionnelle (see chapter 92). I desperately tried to clarify the situation. “We have spent the thirty dollars regardless of whether we stay or leave, so this factor should not play a role in our decision.” Needless to say, I gave in and sunk back down in my seat.

The next day, I sat in a marketing meeting. Our advertising campaign had been running for four months and had not met even one of its goals. I was in favor of **scrapping** it. The advertising manager resisted, saying: “But we’ve invested so much money in it. If we stop now, it’ll all have been for nothing.” Another victim of the sunk cost **fallacy**.

> [scrap](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english-chinese-traditional/scrap?q=scrapping): to not continue with a system or plan

A friend struggled for years in a troubled relationship. His girlfriend cheated on him **time and again**. Each time, she came back **repentant** and begged for forgiveness. He explained it to me this way: “I’ve invested so much energy in the relationship, it would be wrong to throw it away.” A classic case of the sunk cost fallacy.

> [time and (time) again](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english-chinese-traditional/time?q=time+and+again): very often
>
> [repentant](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english-chinese-traditional/repentant): feeling sorry for something that you have done

The sunk cost fallacy is most dangerous when we have invested a lot of time, money, energy, or love in something. This investment becomes a reason to carry on, even if we are dealing with a lost cause. The more we invest, the greater the sunk costs are, and the greater the urge to continue becomes.

Investors frequently fall victim to the sunk cost fallacy. Often they base their trading decisions on acquisition prices. “I lost so much money with this stock, I can’t sell it now,” they say. This is **irrational**. The acquisition price should play no role. What counts is the stock’s future performance (and the future performance of alternative investments). Ironically, the more money a share loses, the more investors tend to stick by it.

> [irrational](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english-chinese-traditional/irrational): not using reason or clear thinking

This irrational behavior is driven by a need for consistency. After all, consistency signifies **credibility**. We find contradictions **abominable**. If we decide to cancel a project halfway through, we create a contradiction: We admit that we once thought differently. Carrying on with a meaningless project delays this painful **realization** and **keeps up appearances**.

> [credibility](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english-chinese-traditional/credibility): the fact that someone can be believed or trusted
>
> [abominable](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english-chinese-traditional/abominable): very bad or unpleasant
>
> [realization](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english-chinese-traditional/realization): the fact or moment of starting to understand a situation
>
> [keep up appearances](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english-chinese-traditional/keep-up-appearances): to pretend to be happier, less poor, etc. than you really are, because you do not want people to know how bad your situation is

The Concorde is a prime example of a government **deficit** project. Even though both parties, Britain and France, had long realized that the supersonic aircraft business would never work, they continued to invest enormous sums of money in it—if only to **save face**. Abandoning the project would have been **tantamount to** admitting defeat. The sunk cost fallacy is therefore often referred to as the “**Concorde effect**.” It leads to costly, even **disastrous**, errors of judgment. The Americans extended their involvement in the Vietnam War because of this. Their thinking: “We’ve already sacrificed so much for this war; it’d be a mistake to give up now.”

> [deficit](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english-chinese-traditional/deficit): the total amount by which money spent is more than money received

> [save face](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/save-face): to keep your reputation and avoid others losing respect for you
>
> [tantamount to something](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english-chinese-traditional/tantamount): being almost the same or having the same effect as something, usually something bad
>
> [Concorde fallacy](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/concorde-fallacy): the idea that you should continue to spend money on a project, product, etc. in order not to waste the money or effort you have already put into it, which may lead to bad decisions

“We’ve come this far . . .” “I’ve read so much of this book already . . .” “But I’ve spent two years doing this course . . .” If you recognize any of these thought patterns, it shows that the sunk cost fallacy is at work in a corner of your brain.

Of course, there may be good reasons to continue investing in something to finalize it. But beware of doing so for the wrong reasons, such as to justify non-recoverable investments. Rational decision making requires you to forget about the costs **incurred** **to date**. No matter how much you have already invested, only your assessment of the future costs and benefits counts.

> [incur](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english-chinese-traditional/incur?q=incurred): to experience something, usually something unpleasant, as a result of actions you have taken
>
> [to date](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english-chinese-traditional/to-date): up to the present time
