### Why You See Shapes in the Clouds - Clustering Illusion

In 1957, Swedish opera singer Friedrich Jorgensen bought a tape player to record his vocals. When he listened back to the recording, he heard strange noises throughout, whispers that sounded like supernatural messages. A few years later, he recorded birdsong. This time, he heard the voice of his deceased mother in the background whispering to him: “Fried, my little Fried, can you hear me? It’s Mammy.” That did it. Jorgensen turned his life around and devoted himself to communicating with the deceased via tape recordings.

In 1994, Diane Duyser from Florida also had an **otherworldly** encounter. After biting into a slice of toast and placing it back down on the plate, she noticed the face of the Virgin Mary in it. Immediately, she stopped eating and stored the **divine** message (minus a bite) in a plastic container. In November 2004, she auctioned the still fairly well preserved snack on eBay. Her daily bread earned her $28,000.

In 1978, a woman from New Mexico had a similar experience. Her **tortilla**’s blackened spots resembled Jesus’s face. The press **latched on to** the story, and thousands of people **flocked** to New Mexico to see **the savior** in **burrito** form. Two years earlier, in 1976, the **orbiter** of the Viking spacecraft photographed a rock **formation** that, from high above, looked like a human face. The “face on Mars” made headlines around the world.

And you? Have you ever seen faces in the clouds or the outlines of animals in rocks? Of course. This is perfectly normal. The human brain seeks patterns and rules. In fact, it takes it one step further: If it finds no familiar patterns, it simply invents some. The more **diffuse** the signal, such as the background noise on the tape, the easier it is to find “hidden messages” in it. Twenty-five years after uncovering the “face on Mars,” the Mars global **surveyor** sent back **crisp**, clear images of the rock formations: The **captivating** human face had **dissolved into** plain old **scree**.

These **frothy** examples make the clustering illusion seem **innocuous**; it is not. Consider the financial markets, which **churn out** floods of data every second. **Grinning from ear to ear**, a friend told me that he had discovered a pattern in the sea of data: “If you multiply the percentage change of the Dow Jones by the percentage change of the oil price, you get the move of the gold price in two days’ time.” In other words, if share prices and oil climb or fall in unison, gold will rise the day after tomorrow. His theory worked well for a few weeks, until he began to **speculate** with ever-larger sums and eventually **squandered** his savings. He had sensed a pattern where none existed.

> [frothy](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/frothy): entertaining and easily understood, but not serious or intended to make you think
>
> [innocuous](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english-chinese-traditional/innocuous): completely harmless (= causing no harm)

> [squander](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english-chinese-traditional/squander?q=squandered): to waste money or supplies, or to waste opportunities by not using them to your advantage

oxxxoxxxoxxoooxooxxoo. Is this sequence random or planned? Psychology professor Thomas Gilovich interviewed hundreds of people for an answer. Most did not want to believe the sequence was arbitrary. They figured some law must govern the order of the letters. Wrong, explained Gilovich, and pointed to some dice: It is quite possible to roll the same number four times in a row, which mystifies many people. Apparently we have trouble accepting that such events can take place by chance.

During World War II, the Germans bombed London. Among other **ammunition**, they used V1 rockets, a kind of self-navigating drone. With each attack, the impact sites were carefully plotted on a map, terrifying Londoners: They thought they had discovered a pattern and developed theories about which parts of the city were the safest. However, after the war, statistical analysis confirmed that the distribution was totally random. Today it’s clear why: The V1’s navigation system was extremely inaccurate.

> [ammunition](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english-chinese-traditional/ammunition): objects that can be shot from a weapon, such as bullets or bombs

In conclusion: When it comes to pattern recognition, we are **oversensitive**. Regain your skepticism. If you think you have discovered a pattern, first consider it pure chance. If it seems too good to be true, find a mathematician and have the data tested statistically. And if the crispy parts of your pancake start to look a lot like Jesus’s face, ask yourself: If he really wants to reveal himself, why doesn’t he do it in Times Square or on CNN?

> [oversensitive](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english-chinese-traditional/oversensitive): damaged, changed, or harmed by something that would not affect most people or things
