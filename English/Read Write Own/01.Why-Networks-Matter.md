## Why Networks Matter

*I am thinking about something much more important than bombs. I am thinking about computers. —John von Neumann*

Network design is destiny.

Networks are the organizing framework that enables billions of people to **intelligibly** interact. They decide the world’s winners and losers. Their algorithms decide where money and attention will flow. The structure of a network guides how that network will evolve and where wealth and power accumulate. Given the scale of the internet today, software design decisions **up front**, regardless of how seemingly small, can have cascading downstream consequences. Who controls a given network is the central question when analyzing power on the internet.

> [intelligibly](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english-chinese-traditional/intelligibly): in a way that is clear enough to be understood
>
> [up front](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/up-front): If you give someone an amount of money up front, you pay that person before they do something for you

This is why critics who knock the tech startup industry for placing more emphasis on the digital world than the physical world—on “bits” versus “atoms”—**miss the mark**. The internet’s influence extends far beyond the digital realm. It intersects, **permeates**, and shapes large-scale social and economic landscapes.

> [miss the mark](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english-chinese-traditional/miss-the-mark): to fail to achieve the result that was intended
>
> [permeate](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english-chinese-traditional/permeate?q=permeates): to spread through something and be present in every part of it

Even pro-tech investors **play up** the idea. As Peter Thiel, the venture capitalist and PayPal co-founder, once mused, “We wanted flying cars, instead we got 140 characters.” The dig takes aim at Twitter, which originally limited tweets to 140 characters, but it’s intended to **pan** the perceived **frivolity** of the software-obsessed tech industry at large.

> [play something up](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english-chinese-traditional/play-up): to emphasize a particular quality or part of something, or make it seem more important than it really is, usually for your own advantage
>
> [pan](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english-chinese-traditional/pan): to criticize something severely
>
> [frivolity](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english-chinese-traditional/frivolity): behaviour that is silly and not serious, or things that are silly and not important

Tweets may seem **frivolous**, but they affect everything from personal thoughts and opinions to the outcomes of elections and **pandemics**. People who claim technologists aren’t focusing enough on problems like energy, food, transportation, and housing overlook that the digital and the physical worlds are interconnected and entwined. Internet networks **mediate** most people’s **interactions** with the “real world.”

> [frivolous](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english-chinese-traditional/frivolous): A frivolous activity or object is silly or not important rather than useful or serious.
>
> [pandemic](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english-chinese-traditional/pandemic?q=pandemics): a disease that exists in almost all of an area or in almost all of a group of people, animals or plants
>
> [mediate](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/mediate): to try to end a disagreement by helping the two sides to talk about and agree on a solution
>
> [interaction](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english-chinese-traditional/interaction?q=interactions): an occasion when two or more people or things communicate with or react to each other

The merging of the physical and the digital happens **discreetly**. Science fiction sometimes **portrays** automation as a visible process, where one physical thing gets replaced, one for one, by another as a direct substitution. In reality, most automation happens indirectly, where physical objects **transmute** into digital networks. Robo–travel agents didn’t replace human travel agents. Rather, search engines and travel websites absorbed their tasks. Mail rooms and postboxes still exist, but they handle far lower volumes of correspondence since the rise of email. Personal aircraft haven’t **upended** physical transportation, but internet services like videoconferencing have, in many cases, **obviated** the need for travel.

> [discreetly](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english-chinese-traditional/discreetly): in a way that is careful not to cause embarrassment or attract too much attention, especially by keeping something secret
>
> [portray](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english-chinese-traditional/portray?q=portrays): to represent or describe someone or something in a painting, film, book, or other artistic work
>
> [transmute](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english-chinese-traditional/transmute): to change something completely, especially into something different and better
>
> [upend](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english-chinese-traditional/upend?q=upended): to push or move something so that the part that usually touches the ground is not touching the ground any more
>
> [obviate](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english-chinese-traditional/obviate?q=obviated): to remove a difficulty, especially so that action to deal with it becomes unnecessary

We wanted flying cars, instead we got Zoom.

People tend to underestimate the digital world due to the internet’s newness. Consider the language people use. **Subordinating** prefixes like “e-” in “email” and “e-commerce” diminish digital activities’ value as compared with their “real world” counterparts of “mail” and “commerce.” Yet, increasingly, mail is email and commerce is e-commerce. When people refer to the physical world as the real world, they fail to appreciate where they spend more and more of their time. Innovations like social media that were initially **dismissed** as nonserious can now shape everything from global politics, business, and culture to the worldview of any one person.

> [subordinate](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english-chinese-traditional/subordinate?q=Subordinating): to put someone or something into a less important position
>
> [dismiss](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/dismiss): to decide that something or someone is not important and not worth considering

New technologies will further fuse the digital and the physical worlds. Artificial intelligence will make computers vastly smarter. Virtual and augmented reality headsets will enhance digital experiences, making them more **immersive**. Internet-connected computers embedded in objects and places—also called Internet of Things devices—will **permeate** our environments. Everything around us will have sensors to understand the world as well as **actuators** to alter it. All of this will be mediated through internet networks.

> [immersive](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english-chinese-traditional/immersive): seeming to surround the audience, player, etc. so that they feel completely involved in something
>
> [permeate](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english-chinese-traditional/permeate): to spread through something and be present in every part of it
>
> [actuator](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english-chinese-traditional/actuator): part of a machine or system that moves something or makes something work

So yes, networks matter.

At their most basic level, networks are lists of connections between people or things. Online, they often **catalog** what people might direct their attention toward. They also inform algorithms that further **curate** attention. If you visit your social media feeds, algorithms churn up all **manner** of content and advertisements based on your **presumed** interests. “Likes” on media networks and ratings on marketplaces direct the flow of ideas, interests, and impulses. Without this **curation** the internet would be a **deluge**—unstructured, overwhelming, unusable.

>
> [curate](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/curate): to select things such as documents, music, products, or internet content to be included as part of a list or collection, or on a website

The internet economy **turbocharges** networks. In an industrial economy, corporations **accrue** power mainly through economies of scope and scale; that is, ways of decreasing production costs. The diminishing marginal cost of producing more steel, cars, **pharmaceutical** drugs, **fizzy** sugar water, or whatever other **widget** **lends** an advantage to whoever owns and invests in the means of production. On the internet, the marginal costs of **distribution** are negligible, so power primarily accrues another way: through network effects.

> [turbocharge](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english-chinese-traditional/turbocharge): to make something grow or increase at a faster rate than usual or to make something much more effective
>
> [accrue](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english-chinese-traditional/accrue): to increase in number or amount over a period of time
>
> [pharmaceutical](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english-chinese-traditional/pharmaceutical): relating to the production of medicines
>
> [fizzy](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english-chinese-traditional/fizzy): having a lot of bubbles

Network effects **dictate** that the value of a network grows with the addition of each new node, or connection point. Nodes can be telephone lines, transportation hubs like airports, connection-oriented technologies like computers, or even people. Metcalfe’s law, one well-known **formulation** of the network effect, **stipulates** that the value of a network grows quadratically, meaning **proportional** to the number of nodes squared (that is, raising by an exponent of 2). For the mathematically minded, a network with ten nodes would be twenty-five times as valuable as a network with two nodes, while a network with a hundred nodes would be a hundred times as valuable as one with ten nodes, and so on. The law takes its name from Robert Metcalfe, a co-creator of Ethernet and the electronics maker 3Com who popularized the idea in the 1980s.

> [dictate](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english-chinese-traditional/dictate): to influence something or make it necessary
>
> [formulation](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/formulation): A formulation is also a particular combination of ideas, words, or substances
>
> [stipulate](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english-chinese-traditional/stipulate?q=stipulates): to say exactly how something must be or must be done
>
> [proportional](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/proportional): If two amounts are proportional, they change at the same rate so that the relationship between them does not change

Because not all network connections may be equally useful, some argue for variations to the law. In 1999, David Reed, another computer scientist, put forward his own self-named spin: Reed’s law, which states that the value of large networks can scale exponentially with the size of the network. The formula best applies to social networks, where people are the nodes. Facebook has nearly 3 billion monthly active users. According to Reed’s law, that means Facebook’s network value is 2 to the 3 billionth power—a number so eye-blisteringly large that it would take 3 million pages just to print it.

Whichever approximation of network value you prefer, one thing is clear: the numbers get big, fast.

It makes sense that network effects would dominate the internet, the ultimate network of networks. People cluster around other people. Services such as Twitter, Instagram, and TikTok are valuable because hundreds of millions of people use them. The same is true of many networks that make up the internet. The more people exchange ideas on the web, the richer that information network. The more people message over email and WhatsApp, the more relevant these communication networks. The more people conduct business across Venmo, Square, Uber, and Amazon, the more valuable these marketplaces. As a rule: more people, more value.

Network effects take small advantages and snowball them into avalanches. When corporations are in control, they tend to guard their advantages jealously, making it difficult for anyone to leave. If you build an audience on a corporate network, leaving means **forfeiting** your audience, so you’re discouraged from doing so. This partly explains why power has **consolidated** into the hands of a few large tech companies. If this trend continues, the internet could end up even more centralized, **commandeered** by powerful **intermediaries** that use their might to crowd out innovation and creativity. Left unchecked, this will lead to economic **stasis**, **homogeneity**, unproductivity, and inequality.

>
> [homogeneity](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/homogeneity): the quality of consisting of parts or people that are similar to each other or are of the same type

Some policymakers seek to **defang** the largest internet companies with regulation. Their remedies include blocking **acquisition** attempts and proposing to split companies into parts. Other regulatory proposals require companies to **interoperate**, allowing easy **integrations** between networks. Users could then bring their connections wherever they like, and they could read and post content across networks according to their preferences. Some of these proposals could **rein in** incumbents and make room for competitors, but the best long-term solution is to build new networks from the ground up that won’t lead to concentrations of power for the simple reason that they can’t.

Many well-funded startups are trying to build new corporate networks. If they succeed, they’ll inevitably re-create the same problems with today’s large corporate networks. What we need are new challengers that can win in the market against corporate networks but provide greater societal benefits. Specifically, we need networks that provide benefits like those afforded by the open and permissionless protocol networks that characterized the early internet.
