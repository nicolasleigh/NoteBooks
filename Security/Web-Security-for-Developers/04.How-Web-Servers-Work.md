### Static Resources

##### URL Resolution

When returning a static resource, modern web servers often add data to the HTTP response or process the static resource before returning it. For example, web servers often dynamically compress large resource files by using the gzip algorithm to reduce the bandwidth used in the response, or add caching headers in HTTP responses to instruct the browser to cache and use a local copy of a static resource if a user views it again within a defined window of time. This makes the website more responsive for the user and reduces the load the server has to handle.

##### Content Delivery Networks

A modern innovation designed to improve the delivery speeds of static files is the **content delivery network** (CDN), which will store duplicated copies of static resources in data centers around the world, and quickly deliver those resources to browsers from the nearest physical location. CDNs like Cloudflare, Akamai, or Amazon CloudFront offload the burden of serving large resource files, such as images, to a third party. As such, they allow even small companies to produce responsive websites without a massive server expenditure.

##### Content Management Systems

Plenty of websites still consist of mostly static content. Rather than being coded by hand, these sites are generally built using content management systems (CMSs) that provide authoring tools requiring little to no technical knowledge to write the content. CMSs generally impose a uniform style on the pages and allow administrators to update content directly in the browser.

Using other people’s code to build your site, either by integrating a **CMS** or using plug-in services, theoretically makes you more secure because these third parties employ security professionals and have an incentive to secure their services. However, the ubiquity of these services and plug-ins also makes them a target for hackers. For example, many self-hosted instances of WordPress, the most popular CMS, are infrequently patched. You can easily discover WordPress vulnerabilities through a simple Google search, as shown in Figure 4-2.

### Dynamic Resources

##### NoSQL Databases

NoSQL databases are often **schemaless**, allowing you to add fields to new records without having to upgrade any data structures. To achieve this flexibility, data is often stored in key-value form, or in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON). 

NoSQL database technology also tends to prioritize widescale replication of data over absolute consistency. SQL databases guarantee that simultaneous queries by different client programs will see the same results; NoSQL databases often loosen this constraint and guarantee only **eventual consistency**.

##### Distributed Caches

Distributed caches like Redis or Memcached make caching data straightforward and allow software to share data structures across different servers and processes in a language-agnostic way. Distributed caches can be shared among web servers, making them ideal for storing frequently accessed data that would otherwise have to be retrieved from a database.

Large web companies typically implement their tech stacks as a range of **microservices**—simple, modular services that perform one action on demand—and use distributed caches to communicate between them. Services often communicate via queues stored in a distributed cache: data structures that can put tasks in a waiting state so they can be completed one at a time by numerous worker processes. Services can also use **publish-subscribe** channels that allow many processes to register interest in a type of event, and have them notified en masse when it occurs.
