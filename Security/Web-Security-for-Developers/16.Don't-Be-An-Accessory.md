### Email Fraud

Related to spam email is **phishing email**: the sender attempts to trick the recipient into revealing sensitive personal information such as passwords or credit card details. A common trick is to email a victim with what looks like a password reset email for a website they use, but have the reset link to a **doppelganger domain**—a domain whose name looks superficially similar to the real domain name that hosts a fake version of the site. The fake site will harvest the user’s credentials on behalf of the attacker, and then redirect the user to the real site so the victim is none the wiser.

##### Implement a Sender Policy Framework

Implementing a **Sender Policy Framework** (**SPF**) entails whitelisting the IP addresses that are authorized to send email from your web domain in the DNS. Because SMTP sits on top of the TCP, the IP address that an email is sent from cannot be spoofed in the same way as the `From` header. By explicitly whitelisting IP addresses in your domain name records, mail receiving agents will be able to verify that incoming mail originated from a permitted source. The following code shows how to specify a Sender Policy Framework in your DNS records.

```
v=spf1 ip4:192.0.2.0/24 ip4:198.51.100.123 a -all
```

This record would be added as a .txt record in your domain name records. In this syntax, the `v= argument` defines the version of SPF used. The `ip4`  and `a` flags specify the systems permitted to send messages for the given domain: in this case, a range of IP addresses, and the IP address corresponding to the domain (indicated by the `a` flag) itself. The `-all` flag at the end of the record tells mail providers that if the preceding mechanisms did not match, the message should be rejected.

##### Implement DomainKeys Identified Mail

**DomainKeys** can be used to generate a digital signature for outgoing mail, to prove an email was legitimately sent from your domain and that it wasn’t modified in transit. **DomainKeys Identified Mail** (**DKIM**) uses public-key cryptography, signing outgoing messages from a domain with a private key and allowing recipients to validate the signature by using a public key hosted in DNS. Only the sender knows the private signing key, so only they can generate legitimate signatures. A mail receiving agent will recalculate the signature by combining the email’s content and the public signing key hosted on your domain. If the recalculated signature does not match the signature attached to the mail, the email will be rejected.

To implement DKIM, you need to add a DomainKey in a `.txt` record to your domain.

```
k=rsa; p=MIGfMA0GCSqGSIb3DQEBAQUAA4GNADCBiQKBgQDDmzRmJRQxLEuyYiyMg4suA
```

In this example, `k` indicates the key type, and `p` is the public key used to recalculate the signature.

### Disguising Malicious Links in Email

Spam algorithms look for malicious links in email, and to support this, webmail providers keep up-to-date blacklists of domains that are known to be harmful. Scanning for links to such domains is a common and effective way to block dangerous email. As such, scammers have had to come up with new tricks to disguise harmful links, to prevent their email from being flagged and sent directly to the junk folder. One way to do this is to use a **URL-shortening service** like **Bitly**, which will encode a URL in a shorter form and redirect the user when they visit the link. However, in the ever-escalating spam wars, email scanning algorithms now unroll links to known URL-shortening services and check whether the final destination is harmful.

Hackers have found a subtler way to disguise malicious links in email. If your website can be used to disguise a link to an arbitrary URL on the internet—if you implement an **open redirect** anywhere on your site—you may be helping hackers disguise malicious links in the same way as a URL-shortening service. Not only are you making your users vulnerable to **phishing** scams, but the *genuine* email you send is liable to be blacklisted by spam-detection algorithms.

##### Open Redirects

In HTTP, a redirect occurs when a web server responds with a `301` (temporary redirect) or `302` (permanent redirect) response code, and supplies a URL that the browser should navigate to instead. One of the most common uses of redirects is to send an unauthenticated user to the login page if they attempt to visit a site. In this scenario, the site typically issues a second redirect back to the original URL after the user has authenticated themselves.

To enable this second redirect, the web server has to remember the original destination as the user logs in. Frequently, this is done by encoding the final destination URL within a query parameter in the login URL. If a hacker can encode an arbitrary URL in this query parameter—in other words, if the second redirect can send the user to a whole different website on the internet—you have what is known as an **open redirect**.

##### Preventing Open Redirects

Most sites won’t ever need to redirect to an external URL. If any part of your website encodes a URL within another URL for the purpose of redirecting the user to that destination, you should make sure that these encoded URLs are *relative* URLs rather than *absolute* URLs: encoded links should point within your site, rather than externally. 

Relative URLs begin with a forward slash (`/`), which is easy to check for. Hackers have found a few ways to disguise absolute URLs to look like relative URLs, so your code needs to account for that. Listing 16-3 shows how to check that a URL is a relative URL via simple pattern-matching logic.

```python
# Listing 16-3: A function to check that a link is relative (internal to a website), using a regular expression in Python

import re 
def is_relative(url):   
	return re.match(r"^\/[^\/\\]", url)
```

> ```python
> r"^\/[^\/\\]"
> ```
>
> 1. **`^`**: This asserts the position at the start of the string. It means that whatever follows must appear at the beginning of the `url`.
>
> 2. **`\/`**: This matches a forward slash (`/`). The backslash (`\`) is used to escape the forward slash because, in a regular expression, a forward slash could be a delimiter.
>
> 3. **`[^\/\\]`**: This is a character class that matches any single character except the ones listed inside the brackets. 
>    - `^` at the start of the brackets negates the class.
>    - `\/` indicates that it does not match a forward slash.
>    - `\\` indicates that it does not match a backslash (`\`). The backslash is escaped here, so `\\` represents a single backslash in the actual matching.
>
> Putting it all together, this regular expression checks if the `url` starts with a `/` followed by any character that is **not** another `/` or a `\`.
>

This pattern states that the URL must begin with a forward slash, and the following character must not be another forward slash or a backslash (`\`). The second character is checked to protect against URLs such as `//:www.google.com`, which are interpreted by browsers as absolute URLs; they will be automatically prefixed by `http` or `https` depending on what protocol the page is currently using.

Another approach to preventing open redirects is to avoid encoding URLs within query parameters *altogether*. If you are encoding a URL for an eventual redirect following login, consider dropping the URL in a temporary cookie instead of a query parameter. An attacker is unable to forge a cookie in a victim’s browser quite as easily, so you will close the door to abusive linking.

##### Other Considerations

Some types of websites do require external links to be posted by users. For instance, if you run a social news site, your users will often post links to external URLs. If this applies to your site, use the **Google Safe Browsing** API to check each URL against a blacklist of harmful sites.

### Clickjacking

HTML permits a web page to contain another web page, by using an `<iframe>` tag. This allows content from different web domains to be mixed in a controlled fashion, because JavaScript running on the page within the frame cannot access the containing page. The `<iframe>` tags are commonly used to embed third-party content in a web page—**OAuth** and **CAPTCHA** widgets often use them to secure cookies.

As with anything useful on the internet, hackers have found ways to abuse `<iframe>` tags. Modern CSS allows page elements to be layered on top of each other using the `z-index` attribute; elements with a higher `z-index` will hide elements with a lower `z-index` and receive click events first. Page elements can also be made transparent using the `opacity` attribute. By combining these techniques, a hacker can position a transparent `<div>` over an `<iframe>` element, and then trick a victim into clicking whatever content is stored in the `<div>` rather than the underlying content they believe they are clicking.

This click-hijacking—**clickjacking**—has been used in a variety of ways. In some cases, victims have been tricked into switching on their webcam so the attacker can watch them remotely. Another variation of this technique is **likejacking**, whereby a victim is tricked into liking something on Facebook without their knowledge. Selling likes on the dark web for promotional purposes is a big money-spinner for a hacker.

##### Preventing Clickjacking

If you run a website, you should make sure your site isn’t used as bait in a clickjacking attack. Most sites never need to be hosted in `<iframe>` tags, so you should tell the browser that directly. Modern browsers support the `Content-Security-Policy` header that allows the response from the server to specify that the page should have no `frame-ancestors`:

```
Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors 'none'
```

Implementing this policy tells the browser to never put your website in a frame.

If for some reason your site does need to be contained within an `<iframe>`, you should tell the browsers which sites are permitted to host such a frame. You can do this by using the same `Content-Security-Policy` header to specify that the website can be its own frame ancestor. The following shows how to use the keyword `self` to permit your site to host `iframes` pointing to other parts of the same site.

```
Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors 'self'
```

Finally, if you need third-party websites to be able to host your site in a frame, you can whitelist individual web domains:

```
Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors example.com google.com
```

### Server-Side Request Forgery

Hackers making malicious HTTP requests often seek to disguise where those requests are launched from. For instance, **denial-of-service** attacks are more effective when coming from many different IP addresses. If your web server makes outgoing HTTP requests, and a hacker can control which URLs those requests are sent to, you are vulnerable to a **server-side request forgery** (**SSRF**) attack, and a hacker can use your server to send malicious requests.

Typically, **SSRF** vulnerabilities occur when the outbound URL of an HTTP request sent from the web server is insecurely constructed from a part of an HTTP request sent to the server. A hacker will check a site for SSRF vulnerabilities by spidering through it, navigating to every page, and using hacking tools to replace every HTTP parameter they encounter with a URL under their control. If they detect any HTTP requests to their trap URL, they know the requests must have been triggered from your server, and that you are vulnerable to SSRF.

##### Protecting Against Server-Side Forgery

You can protect yourself against server-side forgery at several levels. The first, and most important step, is to audit any parts of your code that make outbound HTTP requests. You will almost always know ahead of time which domains need to be invoked as part of API calls, so the construction of URLs for API calls should use web domains recorded in your configuration or code rather than coming from the client. One way of ensuring this is to use the **software development kit** (**SDK**) that is usually made freely available with most APIs. Whitelisting the individual domains that you need access to in your firewall, and banning all others, is a good way to catch any security issues you may have overlooked during code review.
