Hackers frequently use publicized security vulnerabilities, especially **zero-day vulnerabilities**—security flaws that have been made public in the last 24 hours. When someone publishes a zero-day vulnerability for a software component, hackers will immediately scan for web servers running the vulnerable software in order to exploit the security hole. To protect yourself from such threats, you should ensure that your web server doesn’t leak information about the type of software stack you’re running on. If you inadvertently advertise your server technology, you’re making yourself a target.

### Mitigation 1: Disable Telltale Server Headers

Make sure to disable any HTTP response headers in your web server configuration that reveal the server technology, language, and version you’re running. By default, web servers usually send a `Server` header back with each response, describing which software is running on the server side. This is great advertising for the web server vendor, but the browser doesn’t use it. It simply tells an attacker which vulnerabilities they can probe for. Make sure your web server configuration disables this `Server` header.

### Mitigation 2: Use Clean URLs

When you design your website, avoid telltale file suffixes in URLs, such as `.php`, `.asp`, and `.jsp`. Implement **clean URLs** instead—URLs that do not give away implementation details.

### Mitigation 3: Use Generic Cookie Parameters

The name of the cookie your web server uses to store session state frequently reveals your server-side technology. For instance, Java web servers usually store the session ID under a cookie named `JSESSIONID`.

### Mitigation 4: Disable Client-Side Error Reporting

You must disable error reporting on the client side in your production environment. You should keep the error page your users see completely generic. At most, users should know that an unexpected error occurred and that someone is looking into the problem. Detailed error reports should be kept in production logs and error reporting tools, which only administrators can access.

### Mitigation 5: Minify or Obfuscate Your JavaScript Files

Many web developers preprocess their JavaScript code before deploying it by using a **minifier**, which takes JavaScript code and outputs a functionally equivalent but highly compressed JavaScript file. Minifiers remove all extraneous characters (such as whitespace) and replace some code statements with shorter, semantically identical statements. A related tool is an **obfuscator**, which replaces method and function names with short, meaningless tokens without changing any behavior in the code, deliberately making the code less readable. The popular `UglifyJS` utility has both capabilities, and can be invoked directly from the command line with the syntax `uglifyjs [input files]`, which makes it straightforward to plug into your build process.

### Mitigation 6: Sanitize Your Client-Side Files

Hacking tools make it easy for an attacker to crawl your site and extract any comments that you’ve accidentally left behind—hackers often use this technique to scan for private IP addresses accidentally left in comments. This is often a first port of call when a hacker is attempting to compromise your website.
