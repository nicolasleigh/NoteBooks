## GraphQL Fundamentals

### GraphQL Operation: Query

[GitHub GraphQL Explorer](https://docs.github.com/en/graphql/overview/explorer)

```json
query{
  viewer{
    name
    url
  }
}

// Output
{
  "data": {
    "viewer": {
      "name": "Nicolas Leigh",
      "url": "https://github.com/nicolasleigh"
    }
  }
}
```

The viewer is an object in GraphQL terms. Objects hold data about an entity. This data is accessed using a so-called field in GraphQL. Fields are used to ask for specific properties in objects. For instance, the viewer object exposes a wide range of fields. Two fields for the object–name and url–were used in the query.

```json
query{
  organization(login: "facebook"){
    name
    url
    createdAt
  }
}

// Output
{
  "data": {
    "organization": {
      "name": "Meta",
      "url": "https://github.com/facebook",
      "createdAt": "2009-04-02T03:35:22Z"
    }
  }
}
```

If you ever wanted to request data about two identical objects, you would have to use aliases in GraphQL:

```json
{
  company: organization(login: "facebook") {
    name
    url
    createdAt
  }
  book: organization(login: "the-road-to-learn-react") {
    name
    url
    createdAt
  }
}

// Output
{
  "data": {
    "company": {
      "name": "Meta",
      "url": "https://github.com/facebook",
      "createdAt": "2009-04-02T03:35:22Z"
    },
    "book": {
      "name": "The Road to React",
      "url": "https://github.com/the-road-to-learn-react",
      "createdAt": "2017-10-20T04:12:42Z"
    }
  }
}
```

Use fragments to extract the query’s reusable parts:

```json
{
  company: organization(login: "facebook") {
    ...sharedOrganizationFields
  }
  book: organization(login: "the-road-to-learn-react") {
    ...sharedOrganizationFields
  }
}

fragment sharedOrganizationFields on Organization {
  name
  url
  createdAt
}

// Output
{
  "data": {
    "company": {
      "name": "Meta",
      "url": "https://github.com/facebook",
      "createdAt": "2009-04-02T03:35:22Z"
    },
    "book": {
      "name": "The Road to React",
      "url": "https://github.com/the-road-to-learn-react",
      "createdAt": "2017-10-20T04:12:42Z"
    }
  }
}
```

Open the "Docs",  you can see some fields are common GraphQL types such as `String`, `Int` and `Boolean`, while some other types are custom types like the `Organization` type we used. In addition, you can see whether arguments are required when requesting fields on an object. It can be identified by the exclamation point. For instance, a field with a `String!` argument requires that you pass in a `String` argument whereas a field with a `String` argument doesn’t require you to pass it.

In the previous queries, you provided arguments that identified an organization to your fields; but you inlined these arguments in your query. Think about a query like a function, where it’s important to provide dynamic arguments to it. That’s where the variable in GraphQL comes in, as it allows arguments to be extracted as variables from queries. Here’s how an organization’s login argument can be extracted to a dynamic variable:

```json
query ($organization: String!) {
  organization(login: $organization) {
    name
    url
    createdAt
  }
}
```

It defines the organization argument as a variable using the `$` sign. Also, the argument’s type is defined as a `String`. Since the argument is required to fulfil the query, the `String` type has an exclamation point.

In the "Variables" panel, enter this and you should get the same answer as before:

```json
{ 
  "organization": "facebook" 
}
```

You can also define a default variable in GraphQL. It has to be a non-required argument, or an error will occur about a nullable variable or non-null variable. For learning about default variables, we’ll make the `organization` argument non-required by omitting the exclamation point. Afterwards, it can be passed as a default variable.

```
query ($organization: String = "facebook") {
  organization(login: $organization) {
    name
    url
    createdAt
  }
}
```

Before, you used the shorthand version of a query by omitting the `query` statement, but the query statement has to be there now that it’s using variables.

The `query` statement is also called operation type in GraphQL lingua. For instance, it can also be a `mutation` statement. In addition to the operation type, you can also define an operation name.

```
query OrganizationForLearningReact { 
	organization(login: "the-road-to-learn-react") {
  	name 
  	url 
  }
}
```

Compare it to anonymous and named functions in your code. A named query provides a certain level of clarity about what you want to achieve with the query in a declarative way, and it helps with debugging multiple queries, so it should be used when you want to implement an application. Your final query, without showing the variables panel again, could look like the following:

```
query OrganizationForLearningReact($organization: String = "facebook") {
  organization(login: $organization) {
    name
    url
    createdAt
  }
}
```

Let’s see how to access a nested object from within the graph with a query:

```
query OrganizationForLearningReact($organization: String!, $repository: String!) {
  organization(login: $organization) {
    name
    url
    repository(name: $repository) {
      name
    }
  }
}
```

A directive can be used to query data from your GraphQL API in a more powerful way, and they can be applied to fields and objects. Below, we use two types of directives: an include directive, which includes the field when the Boolean type is set to true; and the skip directive, which excludes it instead.

```
query OrganizationForLearningReact($organization: String!, $repository: String!, $withFork: Boolean!) {
  organization(login: $organization) {
    name
    url
    repository(name: $repository) {
      name
      forkCount @include(if: $withFork)
    }
  }
}
```

### GraphQL Operation: Mutation

Query the repository's ID:

```
query {
  organization(login: "the-road-to-learn-react") {
    name
    url
    repository(name: "the-road-to-learn-react") {
      id
      name
    }
  }
}
```

Use `mutation` to add star, in the meantime put the repository's ID in the "Variables" panel:

```
mutation AddStar($repoID: ID!) {
  addStar(input: {starrableId: $repoID}) {
    starrable {
      id
      viewerHasStarred
    }
  }
}
```

You can define the return values of the `mutation` by using objects and fields again. Here we return `id` and `viewerHasStarred` fields.

### GraphQL Pagination

```json
query OrganizationForLearningReact {
  organization(login: "facebook") {
    name
    url
    repositories(first: 2, after: "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpHOAAtEuw==") {
      edges {
        node {
          name
          createdAt
        }
        cursor
      }
    }
  }
}

// Output
{
  "data": {
    "organization": {
      "name": "Meta",
      "url": "https://github.com/facebook",
      "repositories": {
        "edges": [
          {
            "node": {
              "name": "folly",
              "createdAt": "2012-06-01T20:49:04Z"
            },
            "cursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpHOAEUIlQ=="
          },
          {
            "node": {
              "name": "watchman",
              "createdAt": "2012-11-29T23:35:52Z"
            },
            "cursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpHOAGnAOQ=="
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Retrieving the `cursor` field for every repository may be verbose when using only the `cursor` of the last repository, so you can remove the `cursor` field for an individual edge, but add the `pageInfo` object with its `endCursor` and `hasNextPage` fields. You can also request the `totalCount` of the list.

```json
query OrganizationForLearningReact {
  organization(login: "facebook") {
    name
    url
    repositories(first: 2, after: "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpHOAAtEuw==") {
      totalCount
      edges {
        node {
          name
          createdAt
        }
        cursor
      }
      pageInfo {
        endCursor
        hasNextPage
      }
    }
  }
}

// Output
{
  "data": {
    "organization": {
      "name": "Meta",
      "url": "https://github.com/facebook",
      "repositories": {
        "totalCount": 143,
        "edges": [
          {
            "node": {
              "name": "folly",
              "createdAt": "2012-06-01T20:49:04Z"
            },
            "cursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpHOAEUIlQ=="
          },
          {
            "node": {
              "name": "watchman",
              "createdAt": "2012-11-29T23:35:52Z"
            },
            "cursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpHOAGnAOQ=="
          }
        ],
        "pageInfo": {
          "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpHOAGnAOQ==",
          "hasNextPage": true
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
