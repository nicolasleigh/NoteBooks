## Customizing  and organizing  GraphQL operations

### Customizing fields with arguments

#### Identifying a single record to return

```
# Listing 3.1 Using field arguments

query UserInfo {
  user(email: "jane@doe.name") {
    firstName
    lastName
    username
  }
}
```

The `email` part inside the `user` field is called a **field argument**.

Some GraphQL APIs even have a singlerecord field for every object in the system. This is commonly known in the GraphQL world as a Node interface: a concept popularized by the Relay framework (which also originated at Facebook). With a Node interface, you can look up any node in the data graph by its unique global system-wide ID. Then, based on what that node is, you can use an inline fragment to specify the properties on that node that you are interested in seeing in the response.

```
# Listing 3.2 Identifying a single global node

query NodeInfo {
  node(id: "A-GLOBALLY-UNIQUE-ID-HERE") {
    ... on USER {
      firstName
      lastName
      username
      email
    }
  }
}
```

In the GitHub API, some examples of single-record fields are user, repository, project, and organization. Here is an example to read information about the jsComplete organization:

```
query OrgInfo {
  organization(login: "jscomplete") {
    name
    description
    websiteUrl
  }
}
```

#### Limiting the number of records returned by a list field

```
# Listing 3.4 First 10 repos under the organization

query First10Repos {
  organization(login: "jscomplete") {
    name
    description
    websiteUrl
    repositories(first: 10) {
      nodes {
        name
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Ordering records returned by a list field

```
# Listing 3.5 First 10 repos under an organization

query orgReposByName {
  organization(login: "jscomplete") {
    repositories(first: 10, orderBy: {field: NAME, direction: ASC}) {
      nodes {
        name
      }
    }
  }
}
```

```
# Listing 3.6 10 most popular repos under an organization

query OrgPopularRepos {
  organization(login: "jscomplete") {
    repositories(first: 10, orderBy: {field: STARGAZERS, direction: DESC}) {
      nodes {
        name
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Paginating through a list of records

In the GitHub API, you can use the field arguments after and before to offset the results returned by the arguments first and last, respectively.

 To use these arguments, you need to work with node identifiers, which are different than database record identifiers. The pagination interface that the GitHub API uses is called the Connection interface (which originated from the Relay framework as well). In that interface, every record is identified by a node field (similar to the Node interface) using a cursor field. The cursor is basically the ID field for each node, and it is the field we use with the before and after arguments.

```
# Listing 3.7 Working with cursors under edges

query OrgRepoConnectionExample {
  organization(login: "jscomplete") {
    repositories(first: 10, orderBy: {field: CREATED_AT, direction: ASC}) {
      edges {
        cursor
        node {
          name
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

```
# Listing 3.8 Fetching the second page of repos

query OrgRepoConnectionExample2 {
  organization(login: "jscomplete") {
    repositories(
      first: 10
      after: "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK5MjAxNy0wMS0yMVQwODo1NTo0My0wODowMM4Ev4A3"
      orderBy: {field: CREATED_AT, direction: ASC}
    ) {
      edges {
        cursor
        node {
          name
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

```
# Listing 3.9 Meta-pagination information

query OrgReposMetaInfoExample {
  organization(login: "jscomplete") {
    repositories(
      first: 10
      after: "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpILzgtlrVU="
      orderBy: {field: STARGAZERS, direction: DESC}
    ) {
      totalCount
      pageInfo {
        hasNextPage
      }
      edges {
        cursor
        node {
          name
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Searching and filtering

```
# Listing 3.10 Using field arguments to search

query SearchExample {
  repository(owner: "twbs", name: "bootstrap") {
    projects(search: "v4.1", first: 10) {
      nodes {
        name
      }
    }
  }
}
```

By default, the list of your repositories under the viewer field includes all the repositories that you own or can contribute to. To list only the repositories that you own, you can use the affiliations field argument.

```
# Listing 3.11 Using field arguments to filter

query FilterExample {
  viewer {
    repositories(first: 10, affiliations: OWNER) {
      totalCount
      nodes {
        name
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Providing input for mutations

```
# Listing 3.12 Arguments to provide mutation input

mutation StarARepo {
  addStar(input: {starrableId: "MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjU2ODEwMDY="}) {
    starrable {
      stargazers {
        totalCount
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Renaming fields with aliases

```
# Listing 3.14 Profile information query with an alias

query ProfileInfoWithAlias {
  user(login: "samerbuna") {
    name
    companyName: company
    bio
  }
}
```

### Customizing responses with directives

Every GraphQL schema has three built-in directives: @include, @skip, and @deprecated. Some schemas have more directives.

```
# Listing 3.15 All the supported directives in a schema

query AllDirectives {
  __schema {
    directives {
      name
      description
      locations
      args {
        name
        description
        defaultValue
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Variables and input values

```
# Listing 3.16 Using variables for argument values

query OrgInfo($orgLogin: String!) {
  organization(login: $orgLogin) {
    name
    description
    websiteUrl
  }
}
```

```
# Listing 3.17 Using default values for variables

query OrgInfoWithDefault($orgLogin: String = "jscomplete") {
  organization(login: $orgLogin) {
    name
    description
    websiteUrl
  }
}
```

#### The @include directive

```
# Listing 3.18 The @include directive

query OrgInfo($orgLogin: String!, $fullDetails: Boolean!) {
  organization(login: $orgLogin) {
    name
    description
    websiteUrl @include(if: $fullDetails)
  }
}
```

#### The @skip directive

```
# Listing 3.19 The @skip directive

query OrgInfo($orgLogin: String!, $partialDetails: Boolean!) {
  organization(login: $orgLogin) {
    name
    description
    websiteUrl @skip(if: $partialDetails)
  }
}
```

Neither @include nor @skip has precedence over the other. When used together, a field is included only when the include condition is true and the skip condition is false; it is excluded when either the include condition is false or the skip condition is true. The following query will never include websiteUrl no matter what value you use for $partialDetails.

```
# Listing 3.20 Using @include and @skip together

query OrgInfo($orgLogin: String!, $partialDetails: Boolean!) {
  organization(login: $orgLogin) {
    name
    description
    websiteUrl @skip(if: $partialDetails) @include(if: false)
  }
}
```

#### The @deprecated directive

When deprecating a field in a GraphQL schema, the @deprecated directive supports a reason argument to provide the reason behind the deprecation.

```
# Listing 3.21 The @deprecated directive

type User {
  emailAddress: String
  email: String @deprecated(reason: "Use 'emailAddress'.")
}
```

### GraphQL fragments

#### Defining and using fragments

```
# Listing 3.22 Defining a fragment in GraphQL

fragment orgFields on Organization {
  name
  description
  websiteUrl
}
```

The `on Organization` part of the definition is called the type condition of the fragment. Since a fragment is essentially a selection set, you can only define fragments on object types. You cannot define a fragment on a scalar value.

```
# Listing 3.23 Using a fragment in GraphQL

query OrgInfoWithFragment {
  organization(login: "jscomplete") {
    ...orgFields
  }
}
```

The concept of spreading a fragment is similar to the concept of spreading an object in JavaScript. The three-dotted fragment name (`...orgFields`) is called a fragment spread.

A fragment spread can only be used when the type condition of that fragment matches the type of the object under which you want to use that fragment. There are no generic fragments in GraphQL. Also, when a fragment is defined in a GraphQL document, that fragment must be used somewhere. You cannot send a GraphQL server a document that defines fragments but does not use them.

#### Fragments and DRY

```
# Listing 3.24 Example query with repeated sections

query MyRepos {
  viewer {
    ownedRepos: repositories(affiliations: OWNER, first: 10) {
      nodes {
        nameWithOwner
        description
        forkCount
      }
    }
    orgsRepos: repositories(affiliations: ORGANIZATION_MEMBER, first: 10) {
      nodes {
        nameWithOwner
        description
        forkCount
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This query uses a simple alias with field arguments to have two lists with an identical structure.

The nodes field is defined on the special RepositoryConnection in GitHub (it is the connection between a user and a list of repositories).

```
# Listing 3.25 Using fragments to minimize repetition

query MyRepos {
  viewer {
    ownedRepos: repositories(affiliations: OWNER, first: 10) {
      ...repoInfo
    }
    orgsRepos: repositories(affiliations: ORGANIZATION_MEMBER, first: 10) {
      ...repoInfo
    }
  }
}

fragment repoInfo on RepositoryConnection {
  nodes {
    nameWithOwner
    description
    forkCount
  }
}
```

#### Inline fragments for interfaces and unions

Inline fragments are, in a way, similar to anonymous functions that you can use without a name. They are just fragments without names, and you can spread them inline where you define them.

```
# Listing 3.34 Inline fragment example

query InlineFragmentExample {
  repository(owner: "facebook", name: "graphql") {
    ref(qualifiedName: "master") {
      target {
        ... on Commit {
          message
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

To understand the value of inline fragments, you first need to understand the concepts of unions and interfaces in GraphQL.

 Interfaces and unions are abstract types in GraphQL. An interface defines a list of “shared” fields, and a union defines a list of possible object types. Object types in a GraphQL schema can implement an interface that guarantees that the implementing object type will have the list of fields defined by the implemented interface. Object types defined as unions guarantee that what they return will be one of the possible types of that union.

 In the previous example query, the target field is an interface that represents a Git object. Since a Git object can be a commit, tag, blob, or tree, all these object types in the GitHub API implement the GitObject interface; because of that, they all get a guarantee that they implement all the fields a GitObject implements (like repository, since a Git object belongs to a single repository).

The inline fragment in the previous query essentially means this exact condition: if the object pointed to by the reference is a commit, then return the message of that commit. Otherwise, the target will return nothing. You can use another inline fragment to add more cases for the condition.

 The union concept is probably a bit easier to understand. It is basically `OR` logic. A type can be this or that. In fact, some union types are named `xOrY`. In the GitHub API, you can see an example under a repository field, where you can ask for `issueOrPullRequest`. Within this union type, the only field you can ask for is the special `__typename` meta-field, which can be used to answer the question, “Is this an issue or a pull request?”

```
# Listing 3.35 Example GraphQL union type

query RepoUnionExample {
  repository(owner: "facebook", name: "graphql") {
    issueOrPullRequest(number: 3) {
      __typename
    }
  }
}
```

The `issueOrPullRequest` with number 3 on this repository happens to be an issue. If you try the query with number 5 instead of 3, you should see a pull request. An inline fragment is useful here to conditionally pick fields within an `issueOrPullRequest` based on the type. For example, maybe we are interested in the merge information of a pull request and the closing information of an issue. Here is a query to pick these different fields based on the type of the `issueOrPullRequest` whose number is 5.

```
# Listing 3.36 Using inline fragments with union types

query RepoUnionExampleFull {
  repository(owner: "facebook", name: "graphql") {
    issueOrPullRequest(number: 5) {
      ... on PullRequest {
        merged
        mergedAt
      }
      ... on Issue {
        closed
        closedAt
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Another common use of union types is to implement a search field to search among multiple types. For example, a GitHub user search might return a user object or an organization object. Here is a query to search GitHub users for the term "graphql".

```
# Listing 3.37 The union-type search field

query TestSearch {
  search(first: 100, query: "graphql", type: USER) {
    nodes {
      ... on User {
        name
        bio
      }
      ... on Organization {
        login
        description
      }
    }
  }
}
```
