# Objects

There are eight data types in JavaScript. Seven of them are called "primitive", because their values contain only a single thing (be it a string or a number or whatever). In contrast, objects are used to store keyed collections of various data and more complex entities.

### Computed properties

We can use square brackets in an object literal, when creating an object. That's called _computed properties_.

For instance:

```js run
let fruit = prompt("Which fruit to buy?", "apple");

let bag = {
  [fruit]: 5, // the name of the property is taken from the variable fruit
};

alert(bag.apple); // 5 if fruit="apple"
```

The meaning of a computed property is simple: `[fruit]` means that the property name should be taken from `fruit`.

So, if a visitor enters `"apple"`, `bag` will become `{apple: 5}`.

Essentially, that works the same as:

```js run
let fruit = prompt("Which fruit to buy?", "apple");
let bag = {};

// take property name from the fruit variable
bag[fruit] = 5;
```

We can use more complex expressions inside square brackets:

```js
let fruit = "apple";
let bag = {
  [fruit + "Computers"]: 5, // bag.appleComputers = 5
};
```

Square brackets are much more powerful than dot notation. They allow any property names and variables. But they are also more cumbersome to write.

## Property value shorthand

```js run
function makeUser(name, age) {
  return {
    name: name,
    age: age,
    // ...other properties
  };
}

let user = makeUser("John", 30);
alert(user.name); // John
```

In the example above, properties have the same names as variables. The use-case of making a property from a variable is so common, that there's a special _property value shorthand_ to make it shorter.

Instead of `name:name` we can just write `name`, like this:

```js
function makeUser(name, age) {
  return {
    name, // same as name: name
    age, // same as age: age
    // ...
  };
}
```

We can use both normal properties and shorthands in the same object:

```js
let user = {
  name, // same as name:name
  age: 30,
};
```

## Property names limitations

```js run
// these properties are all right
let obj = {
  for: 1,
  let: 2,
  return: 3,
};

alert(obj.for + obj.let + obj.return); // 6
```

In short, there are no limitations on property names. They can be any strings or symbols.

Other types are automatically converted to strings.

For instance, a number `0` becomes a string `"0"` when used as a property key:

```js run
let obj = {
  0: "test", // same as "0": "test"
};

// both alerts access the same property (the number 0 is converted to string "0")
alert(obj["0"]); // test
alert(obj[0]); // test (same property)
```

There's a minor gotcha with a special property named `__proto__`. We can't set it to a non-object value:

```js run
let obj = {};
obj.__proto__ = 5; // assign a number
alert(obj.__proto__); // [object Object] - the value is an object, didn't work as intended
```

As we see from the code, the assignment to a primitive `5` is ignored.

## Property existence test, "in" operator

A notable feature of objects in JavaScript, compared to many other languages, is that it's possible to access any property. There will be no error if the property doesn't exist!

Reading a non-existing property just returns `undefined`. So we can easily test whether the property exists:

```js run
let user = {};

alert(user.noSuchProperty === undefined); // true means "no such property"
```

There's also a special operator `"in"` for that.

The syntax is:

```js
"key" in object;
```

For instance:

```js run
let user = { name: "John", age: 30 };

alert("age" in user); // true, user.age exists
alert("blabla" in user); // false, user.blabla doesn't exist
```

Please note that on the left side of `in` there must be a _property name_. That's usually a quoted string.

If we omit quotes, that means a variable should contain the actual name to be tested. For instance:

```js run
let user = { age: 30 };

let key = "age";
alert(key in user); // true, property "age" exists
```

Why does the `in` operator exist? Isn't it enough to compare against `undefined`?

Well, most of the time the comparison with `undefined` works fine. But there's a special case when it fails, but `"in"` works correctly.

It's when an object property exists, but stores `undefined`:

```js run
let obj = {
  test: undefined,
};

alert(obj.test); // it's undefined, so - no such property?

alert("test" in obj); // true, the property does exist!
```

In the code above, the property `obj.test` technically exists. So the `in` operator works right.

Situations like this happen very rarely, because `undefined` should not be explicitly assigned. We mostly use `null` for "unknown" or "empty" values. So the `in` operator is an exotic guest in the code.

## The "for..in" loop

To walk over all keys of an object, there exists a special form of the loop: `for..in`. This is a completely different thing from the `for(;;)` construct that we studied before.

```js
for (key in object) {
  // executes the body for each key among object properties
}
```

For instance, let's output all properties of `user`:

```js run
let user = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30,
  isAdmin: true,
};

for (let key in user) {
  // keys
  alert(key); // name, age, isAdmin
  // values for the keys
  alert(user[key]); // John, 30, true
}
```

Note that all "for" constructs allow us to declare the looping variable inside the loop, like `let key` here.

### Ordered like an object

Are objects ordered? In other words, if we loop over an object, do we get all properties in the same order they were added? Can we rely on this?

The short answer is: "ordered in a special fashion": integer properties are sorted, others appear in creation order.

```js run
let codes = {
  49: "Germany",
  41: "Switzerland",
  44: "Great Britain",
  // ..,
  1: "USA",
};

for (let code in codes) {
  alert(code); // 1, 41, 44, 49
}
```

The phone codes go in the ascending sorted order, because they are integers. So we see `1, 41, 44, 49`.

The "integer property" term here means a string that can be converted to-and-from an integer without a change.

So, `"49"` is an integer property name, because when it's transformed to an integer number and back, it's still the same. But `"+49"` and `"1.2"` are not:

```js run
// Number(...) explicitly converts to a number
// Math.trunc is a built-in function that removes the decimal part
alert(String(Math.trunc(Number("49")))); // "49", same, integer property
alert(String(Math.trunc(Number("+49")))); // "49", not same "+49" ⇒ not integer property
alert(String(Math.trunc(Number("1.2")))); // "1", not same "1.2" ⇒ not integer property
```

...On the other hand, if the keys are non-integer, then they are listed in the creation order, for instance:

```js run
let user = {
  name: "John",
  surname: "Smith",
};
user.age = 25; // add one more

// non-integer properties are listed in the creation order
for (let prop in user) {
  alert(prop); // name, surname, age
}
```

So, to fix the issue with the phone codes, we can "cheat" by making the codes non-integer. Adding a plus `"+"` sign before each code is enough.

```js run
let codes = {
  "+49": "Germany",
  "+41": "Switzerland",
  "+44": "Great Britain",
  // ..,
  "+1": "USA",
};

for (let code in codes) {
  alert(+code); // 49, 41, 44, 1
}
```
