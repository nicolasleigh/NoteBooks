101. ### Who created javascript

      JavaScript was created by Brendan Eich in 1995 during his time at Netscape Communications. Initially it was developed under the name `Mocha`, but later the language was officially called `LiveScript` when it first shipped in beta releases of Netscape.

102. ### What is the use of preventDefault method

      The preventDefault() method cancels the event if it is cancelable, meaning that the default action or behaviour that belongs to the event will not occur. For example, prevent form submission when clicking on submit button and prevent opening the page URL when clicking on hyperlink are some common use cases.

      ```javascript
      document
        .getElementById("link")
        .addEventListener("click", function (event) {
          event.preventDefault();
        });
      ```

      **Note:** Remember that not all events are cancelable.

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

103. ### What is the use of stopPropagation method

      The stopPropagation method is used to stop the event from bubbling up the event chain. For example, the below nested divs with stopPropagation method prevents default event propagation when clicking on nested div(Div1)

      ```javascript
      <p>Click DIV1 Element</p>
      <div onclick="secondFunc()">DIV 2
        <div onclick="firstFunc(event)">DIV 1</div>
      </div>

      <script>
      function firstFunc(event) {
        alert("DIV 1");
        event.stopPropagation();
      }

      function secondFunc() {
        alert("DIV 2");
      }
      </script>
      ```

104. ### What are the steps involved in return false usage

      The return false statement in event handlers performs the below steps,

      1. First it stops the browser's default action or behaviour.
      2. It prevents the event from propagating the DOM
      3. Stops callback execution and returns immediately when called.

105. ### What is BOM

      The Browser Object Model (BOM) allows JavaScript to "talk to" the browser. It consists of the objects navigator, history, screen, location and document which are children of the window. The Browser Object Model is not standardized and can change based on different browsers.

106. ### What is the use of setTimeout

      The setTimeout() method is used to call a function or evaluate an expression after a specified number of milliseconds. For example, let's log a message after 2 seconds using setTimeout method,

      ```javascript
      setTimeout(function () {
        console.log("Good morning");
      }, 2000);
      ```

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

107. ### What is the use of setInterval

      The setInterval() method is used to call a function or evaluate an expression at specified intervals (in milliseconds). For example, let's log a message after 2 seconds using setInterval method,

      ```javascript
      setInterval(function () {
        console.log("Good morning");
      }, 2000);
      ```

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

108. ### Why is JavaScript treated as Single threaded

      JavaScript is a single-threaded language. Because the language specification does not allow the programmer to write code so that the interpreter can run parts of it in parallel in multiple threads or processes. Whereas languages like java, go, C++ can make multi-threaded and multi-process programs.

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

109. ### What is an event delegation

      Event delegation is a technique for listening to events where you delegate a parent element as the listener for all of the events that happen inside it.

      For example, if you wanted to detect field changes inside a specific form, you can use event delegation technique,

      ```javascript
      var form = document.querySelector("#registration-form");

      // Listen for changes to fields inside the form
      form.addEventListener(
        "input",
        function (event) {
          // Log the field that was changed
          console.log(event.target);
        },
        false
      );
      ```

110. ### What is ECMAScript

      ECMAScript is the scripting language that forms the basis of JavaScript. ECMAScript standardized by the ECMA International standards organization in the ECMA-262 and ECMA-402 specifications. The first edition of ECMAScript was released in 1997.

111. ### What is JSON

      JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight format that is used for data interchanging. It is based on a subset of JavaScript language in the way objects are built in JavaScript.

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

112. ### What are the syntax rules of JSON

      Below are the list of syntax rules of JSON

      1. The data is in name/value pairs
      2. The data is separated by commas
      3. Curly braces hold objects
      4. Square brackets hold arrays

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

113. ### What is the purpose JSON stringify

      When sending data to a web server, the data has to be in a string format. You can achieve this by converting JSON object into a string using stringify() method.

      ```javascript
      var userJSON = { name: "John", age: 31 };
      var userString = JSON.stringify(userJSON);
      console.log(userString); //"{"name":"John","age":31}"
      ```

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

114. ### How do you parse JSON string

      When receiving the data from a web server, the data is always in a string format. But you can convert this string value to a javascript object using parse() method.

      ```javascript
      var userString = '{"name":"John","age":31}';
      var userJSON = JSON.parse(userString);
      console.log(userJSON); // {name: "John", age: 31}
      ```

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

115. ### Why do you need JSON

      When exchanging data between a browser and a server, the data can only be text. Since JSON is text only, it can easily be sent to and from a server, and used as a data format by any programming language.

116. ### What are PWAs

      Progressive web applications (PWAs) are a type of mobile app delivered through the web, built using common web technologies including HTML, CSS and JavaScript. These PWAs are deployed to servers, accessible through URLs, and indexed by search engines.

117. ### What is the purpose of clearTimeout method

      The clearTimeout() function is used in javascript to clear the timeout which has been set by setTimeout()function before that. i.e, The return value of setTimeout() function is stored in a variable and it’s passed into the clearTimeout() function to clear the timer.

      For example, the below setTimeout method is used to display the message after 3 seconds. This timeout can be cleared by the clearTimeout() method.

      ```javascript
      <script>
           var msg;
           function greeting() {
              alert('Good morning');
           }
           function start() {
             msg =setTimeout(greeting, 3000);

           }

           function stop() {
               clearTimeout(msg);
           }
      </script>
      ```

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

118. ### What is the purpose of clearInterval method

      The clearInterval() function is used in javascript to clear the interval which has been set by setInterval() function. i.e, The return value returned by setInterval() function is stored in a variable and it’s passed into the clearInterval() function to clear the interval.

      For example, the below setInterval method is used to display the message for every 3 seconds. This interval can be cleared by the clearInterval() method.

      ```javascript
      <script>
           var msg;
           function greeting() {
              alert('Good morning');
           }
           function start() {
             msg = setInterval(greeting, 3000);

           }

           function stop() {
               clearInterval(msg);
           }
      </script>
      ```

119. ### How do you redirect new page in javascript

      In vanilla javascript, you can redirect to a new page using the `location` property of window object. The syntax would be as follows,

      ```javascript
      function redirect() {
        window.location.href = "newPage.html";
      }
      ```

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

120. ### How do you check whether a string contains a substring

      There are 3 possible ways to check whether a string contains a substring or not,

      1. **Using includes:** ES6 provided `String.prototype.includes` method to test a string contains a substring

      ```javascript
      var mainString = "hello",
        subString = "hell";
      mainString.includes(subString);
      ```

      2. **Using indexOf:** In an ES5 or older environment, you can use `String.prototype.indexOf` which returns the index of a substring. If the index value is not equal to -1 then it means the substring exists in the main string.

      ```javascript
      var mainString = "hello",
        subString = "hell";
      mainString.indexOf(subString) !== -1;
      ```

      3. **Using RegEx:** The advanced solution is using Regular expression's test method(`RegExp.test`), which allows for testing for against regular expressions

      ```javascript
      var mainString = "hello",
        regex = /hell/;
      regex.test(mainString);
      ```

121. ### How do you validate an email in javascript

      You can validate an email in javascript using regular expressions. It is recommended to do validations on the server side instead of the client side. Because the javascript can be disabled on the client side.

      ```javascript
      function validateEmail(email) {
        var re =
          /^(([^<>()\[\]\\.,;:\s@"]+(\.[^<>()\[\]\\.,;:\s@"]+)*)|(".+"))@((\[[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\])|(([a-zA-Z\-0-9]+\.)+[a-zA-Z]{2,}))$/;
        return re.test(String(email).toLowerCase());
      }
      ```

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

      The above regular expression accepts unicode characters.

122. ### How do you get the current url with javascript

      You can use `window.location.href` expression to get the current url path and you can use the same expression for updating the URL too. You can also use `document.URL` for read-only purposes but this solution has issues in FF.

      ```javascript
      console.log("location.href", window.location.href); // Returns full URL
      ```

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

123. ### What are the various url properties of location object

      The below `Location` object properties can be used to access URL components of the page,

      1. href - The entire URL
      2. protocol - The protocol of the URL
      3. host - The hostname and port of the URL
      4. hostname - The hostname of the URL
      5. port - The port number in the URL
      6. pathname - The path name of the URL
      7. search - The query portion of the URL
      8. hash - The anchor portion of the URL

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

124. ### How do get query string values in javascript

      You can use URLSearchParams to get query string values in javascript. Let's see an example to get the client code value from URL query string,

      ```javascript
      const urlParams = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search);
      const clientCode = urlParams.get("clientCode");
      ```

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

125. ### How do you check if a key exists in an object

      You can check whether a key exists in an object or not using three approaches,

      1. **Using in operator:** You can use the in operator whether a key exists in an object or not

         ```javascript
         "key" in obj;
         ```

         and If you want to check if a key doesn't exist, remember to use parenthesis,

         ```javascript
         !("key" in obj);
         ```

      2. **Using hasOwnProperty method:** You can use `hasOwnProperty` to particularly test for properties of the object instance (and not inherited properties)

         ```javascript
         obj.hasOwnProperty("key"); // true
         ```

      3. **Using undefined comparison:** If you access a non-existing property from an object, the result is undefined. Let’s compare the properties against undefined to determine the existence of the property.

         ```javascript
         const user = {
           name: "John",
         };

         console.log(user.name !== undefined); // true
         console.log(user.nickName !== undefined); // false
         ```

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

126. ### How do you loop through or enumerate javascript object

      You can use the `for-in` loop to loop through javascript object. You can also make sure that the key you get is an actual property of an object, and doesn't come from the prototype using `hasOwnProperty` method.

      ```javascript
      var object = {
        k1: "value1",
        k2: "value2",
        k3: "value3",
      };

      for (var key in object) {
        if (object.hasOwnProperty(key)) {
          console.log(key + " -> " + object[key]); // k1 -> value1 ...
        }
      }
      ```

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

127. ### How do you test for an empty object

      There are different solutions based on ECMAScript versions

      1. **Using Object entries(ECMA 7+):** You can use object entries length along with constructor type.

      ```javascript
      Object.entries(obj).length === 0 && obj.constructor === Object; // Since date object length is 0, you need to check constructor check as well
      ```

      2. **Using Object keys(ECMA 5+):** You can use object keys length along with constructor type.

      ```javascript
      Object.keys(obj).length === 0 && obj.constructor === Object; // Since date object length is 0, you need to check constructor check as well
      ```

      3. **Using for-in with hasOwnProperty(Pre-ECMA 5):** You can use a for-in loop along with hasOwnProperty.

      ```javascript
      function isEmpty(obj) {
        for (var prop in obj) {
          if (obj.hasOwnProperty(prop)) {
            return false;
          }
        }

        return JSON.stringify(obj) === JSON.stringify({});
      }
      ```

128. ### What is an arguments object

      The arguments object is an Array-like object accessible inside functions that contains the values of the arguments passed to that function. For example, let's see how to use arguments object inside sum function,

      ```javascript
      function sum() {
        var total = 0;
        for (var i = 0, len = arguments.length; i < len; ++i) {
          total += arguments[i];
        }
        return total;
      }

      sum(1, 2, 3); // returns 6
      ```

      **Note:** You can't apply array methods on arguments object. But you can convert into a regular array as below.

      ```javascript
      var argsArray = Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments);
      ```

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

129. ### How do you make first letter of the string in an uppercase

      You can create a function which uses a chain of string methods such as charAt, toUpperCase and slice methods to generate a string with the first letter in uppercase.

      ```javascript
      function capitalizeFirstLetter(string) {
        return string.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + string.slice(1);
      }
      ```

130. ### What are the pros and cons of for loops

      The for-loop is a commonly used iteration syntax in javascript. It has both pros and cons

      #### Pros

      1. Works on every environment
      2. You can use break and continue flow control statements

      #### Cons

      3. Too verbose
      4. Imperative
      5. You might face off-by-one errors.

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

131. ### How do you display the current date in javascript

      You can use `new Date()` to generate a new Date object containing the current date and time. For example, let's display the current date in mm/dd/yyyy

      ```javascript
      var today = new Date();
      var dd = String(today.getDate()).padStart(2, "0");
      var mm = String(today.getMonth() + 1).padStart(2, "0"); //January is 0!
      var yyyy = today.getFullYear();

      today = mm + "/" + dd + "/" + yyyy;
      document.write(today);
      ```

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

132. ### How do you compare two date objects

      You need to use date.getTime() method in order to compare unix timestamp values

      ```javascript
      var d1 = new Date();
      var d2 = new Date(d1);
      console.log(d1.getTime() === d2.getTime()); //True
      console.log(d1 === d2); // False
      ```

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

133. ### How do you check if a string starts with another string

      You can use ECMAScript 6's `String.prototype.startsWith()` method to check if a string starts with another string or not. But it is not yet supported in all browsers. Let's see an example to see this usage,

      ```javascript
      "Good morning".startsWith("Good"); // true
      "Good morning".startsWith("morning"); // false
      ```

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

134. ### How do you trim a string in javascript

      JavaScript provided a trim method on string types to trim any whitespaces present at the beginning or ending of the string.

      ```javascript
      "  Hello World   ".trim(); //Hello World
      ```

      If your browser(<IE9) doesn't support this method then you can use below polyfill.

      ```javascript
      if (!String.prototype.trim) {
        (function () {
          // Make sure we trim BOM and NBSP
          var rtrim = /^[\s\uFEFF\xA0]+|[\s\uFEFF\xA0]+$/g;
          String.prototype.trim = function () {
            return this.replace(rtrim, "");
          };
        })();
      }
      ```

135. ### How do you add a key value pair in javascript

      There are two possible solutions to add new properties to an object.

      Let's take a simple object to explain these solutions.

      ```javascript
      var object = {
        key1: value1,
        key2: value2,
      };
      ```

      1. **Using dot notation:** This solution is useful when you know the name of the property

      ```javascript
      object.key3 = "value3";
      ```

      2. **Using square bracket notation:** This solution is useful when the name of the property is dynamically determined or the key's name is non-JS like "user-name"

      ```javascript
      obj["key3"] = "value3";
      ```

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

136. ### Is the !-- notation represents a special operator

      No,that's not a special operator. But it is a combination of 2 standard operators one after the other,

      1. A logical not (!)
      2. A prefix decrement (--)

      At first, the value decremented by one and then tested to see if it is equal to zero or not for determining the truthy/falsy value.

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

137. ### How do you assign default values to variables

      You can use the logical or operator `||` in an assignment expression to provide a default value. The syntax looks like as below,

      ```javascript
      var a = b || c;
      ```

      As per the above expression, variable 'a 'will get the value of 'c' only if 'b' is falsy (if is null, false, undefined, 0, empty string, or NaN), otherwise 'a' will get the value of 'b'.

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

138. ### How do you define multiline strings

      You can define multiline string literals using the '\n' character followed by line terminator('\').

      ```javascript
      var str = "This is a \n very lengthy \n sentence!";
      console.log(str);
      ```

      But if you have a space after the '\n' character, there will be indentation inconsistencies.

139. ### What is an app shell model

      An application shell (or app shell) architecture is one way to build a Progressive Web App that reliably and instantly loads on your users' screens, similar to what you see in native applications. It is useful for getting some initial HTML to the screen fast without a network.

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

140. ### Can we define properties for functions

      Yes, we can define properties for functions because functions are also objects.

      ```javascript
      fn = function (x) {
        //Function code goes here
      };

      fn.name = "John";

      fn.profile = function (y) {
        //Profile code goes here
      };
      ```

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

141. ### What is the way to find the number of parameters expected by a function

      You can use `function.length` syntax to find the number of parameters expected by a function. Let's take an example of `sum` function to calculate the sum of numbers,

      ```javascript
      function sum(num1, num2, num3, num4) {
        return num1 + num2 + num3 + num4;
      }
      sum.length; // 4 is the number of parameters expected.
      ```

142. ### What is a polyfill

      A polyfill is a piece of JS code used to provide modern functionality on older browsers that do not natively support it. For example, Silverlight plugin polyfill can be used to mimic the functionality of an HTML Canvas element on Microsoft Internet Explorer 7.

      There are two main polyfill libraries available,

      1. **Core.js**: It is a modular javascript library used for cutting-edge ECMAScript features.
      2. **Polyfill.io:** It provides polyfills that are required for browser needs.

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

143. ### What are break and continue statements

      The break statement is used to "jump out" of a loop. i.e, It breaks the loop and continues executing the code after the loop.

      ```javascript
      for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        if (i === 5) {
          break;
        }
        text += "Number: " + i + "<br>";
      }
      ```

      The continue statement is used to "jump over" one iteration in the loop. i.e, It breaks one iteration (in the loop), if a specified condition occurs, and continues with the next iteration in the loop.

      ```javascript
      for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        if (i === 5) {
          continue;
        }
        text += "Number: " + i + "<br>";
      }
      ```

144. ### What are js labels

      The label statement allows us to name loops and blocks in JavaScript. We can then use these labels to refer back to the code later. For example, the below code with labels avoids printing the numbers when they are same,

      ```javascript
      var i, j;

      loop1: for (i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
        loop2: for (j = 0; j < 3; j++) {
          if (i === j) {
            continue loop1;
          }
          console.log("i = " + i + ", j = " + j);
        }
      }

      // Output is:
      //   "i = 1, j = 0"
      //   "i = 2, j = 0"
      //   "i = 2, j = 1"
      ```

145. ### What are the benefits of keeping declarations at the top

      It is recommended to keep all declarations at the top of each script or function. The benefits of doing this are,

      1. Gives cleaner code
      2. It provides a single place to look for local variables
      3. Easy to avoid unwanted global variables
      4. It reduces the possibility of unwanted re-declarations

146. ### What are the benefits of initializing variables

      It is recommended to initialize variables because of the below benefits,

      1. It gives cleaner code
      2. It provides a single place to initialize variables
      3. Avoid undefined values in the code

147. ### What are the recommendations to create new object

      It is recommended to avoid creating new objects using `new Object()`. Instead you can initialize values based on it's type to create the objects.

      1. Assign {} instead of new Object()
      2. Assign "" instead of new String()
      3. Assign 0 instead of new Number()
      4. Assign false instead of new Boolean()
      5. Assign [] instead of new Array()
      6. Assign /()/ instead of new RegExp()
      7. Assign function (){} instead of new Function()

      You can define them as an example,

      ```javascript
      var v1 = {};
      var v2 = "";
      var v3 = 0;
      var v4 = false;
      var v5 = [];
      var v6 = /()/;
      var v7 = function () {};
      ```

148. ### How do you define JSON arrays

      JSON arrays are written inside square brackets and arrays contain javascript objects. For example, the JSON array of users would be as below,

      ```javascript
      "users":[
        {"firstName":"John", "lastName":"Abrahm"},
        {"firstName":"Anna", "lastName":"Smith"},
        {"firstName":"Shane", "lastName":"Warn"}
      ]
      ```

149. ### How do you generate random integers

      You can use `Math.random()` with `Math.floor()` to return random integers. For example, if you want generate random integers between 1 to 10, the multiplication factor should be 10,

      ```javascript
      Math.floor(Math.random() * 10) + 1; // returns a random integer from 1 to 10
      Math.floor(Math.random() * 100) + 1; // returns a random integer from 1 to 100
      ```

      **Note:** `Math.random()` returns a random number between 0 (inclusive), and 1 (exclusive)

150. ### Can you write a random integers function to print integers within a range

      Yes, you can create a proper random function to return a random number between min and max (both included)

      ```javascript
      function randomInteger(min, max) {
        return Math.floor(Math.random() * (max - min + 1)) + min;
      }
      randomInteger(1, 100); // returns a random integer from 1 to 100
      randomInteger(1, 1000); // returns a random integer from 1 to 1000
      ```
