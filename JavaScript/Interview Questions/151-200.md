151. ### What is tree shaking

     Tree shaking is a form of dead code elimination. It means that unused modules will not be included in the bundle during the build process and for that it relies on the static structure of ES2015 module syntax,( i.e. import and export). Initially this has been popularized by the ES2015 module bundler `rollup`, these days practically all bundlers use this technique.

152. ### What is the need of tree shaking

     Tree Shaking can significantly reduce the code size in any application. i.e, The less code we send over the wire the more performant the application will be. For example, if we just want to create a “Hello World” Application using SPA frameworks then it will take around a few MBs, but by tree shaking it can bring down the size to just a few hundred KBs. Tree shaking is implemented in Rollup and Webpack bundlers.

153. ### Is it recommended to use eval

     No, it allows arbitrary code to be run which causes a security problem. As we know that the eval() function is used to run text as code. In most of the cases, it should not be necessary to use it.

154. ### What is a Regular Expression

     A regular expression is a sequence of characters that forms a search pattern. You can use this search pattern for searching data in a text. These can be used to perform all types of text search and text replace operations. Let's see the syntax format now,

     ```javascript
     /pattern/modifiers;
     ```

     For example, the regular expression or search pattern with case-insensitive username would be,

     ```javascript
     /John/i;
     ```

155. ### What are the string methods that accept Regular expression

     There are six string methods: `search()`, `replace()`, `replaceAll()`, `match()`, `matchAll()`, and `split()`.

     The `search()` method uses an expression to search for a match, and returns the position of the match.

     ```javascript
     var msg = "Hello John";
     var n = msg.search(/John/i); // 6
     ```

     The `replace()` and `replaceAll()` methods are used to return a modified string where the pattern is replaced.

     ```javascript
     var msg = "ball bat";
     var n1 = msg.replace(/b/i, "c"); // call bat
     var n2 = msg.replaceAll(/b/i, "c"); // call cat
     ```

     The `match()` and `matchAll()` methods are used to return the matches when matching a string against a regular expression.

     ```javascript
     var msg = "Hello John";
     var n1 = msg.match(/[A-Z]/g); // ["H", "J"]
     var n2 = msg.matchAll(/[A-Z]/g); // this returns an iterator
     ```

     The `split()` method is used to split a string into an array of substrings, and returns the new array.

     ```javascript
     var msg = "Hello John";
     var n = msg.split(/\s/); // ["Hello", "John"]
     ```

156. ### What are modifiers in regular expression

     Modifiers can be used to perform case-insensitive and global searches. Let's list some of the modifiers,

     | Modifier | Description                                             |
     | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
     | i        | Perform case-insensitive matching                       |
     | g        | Perform a global match rather than stops at first match |
     | m        | Perform multiline matching                              |

     Let's take an example of global modifier,

     ```javascript
     var text = "Learn JS one by one";
     var pattern = /one/g;
     var result = text.match(pattern); // one,one
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

157. ### What are regular expression patterns

     Regular Expressions provide a group of patterns in order to match characters. Basically they are categorized into 3 types,

     1. **Brackets:** These are used to find a range of characters.
        For example, below are some use cases,
        1. [abc]: Used to find any of the characters between the brackets(a,b,c)
        2. [0-9]: Used to find any of the digits between the brackets
        3. (a|b): Used to find any of the alternatives separated with |
     2. **Metacharacters:** These are characters with a special meaning.
        For example, below are some use cases,
        1. \\d: Used to find a digit
        2. \\s: Used to find a whitespace character
        3. \\b: Used to find a match at the beginning or ending of a word
     3. **Quantifiers:** These are useful to define quantities.
        For example, below are some use cases,
        1. n+: Used to find matches for any string that contains at least one n
        2. n\*: Used to find matches for any string that contains zero or more occurrences of n
        3. n?: Used to find matches for any string that contains zero or one occurrences of n

158. ### What is a RegExp object

     RegExp object is a regular expression object with predefined properties and methods. Let's see the simple usage of RegExp object,

     ```javascript
     var regexp = new RegExp("\\w+");
     console.log(regexp);
     // expected output: /\w+/
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

159. ### How do you search a string for a pattern

     You can use the `test()` method of regular expression in order to search a string for a pattern, and return true or false depending on the result.

     ```javascript
     var pattern = /you/;
     console.log(pattern.test("How are you?")); //true
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

160. ### What is the purpose of exec method

     The purpose of exec method is similar to test method but it executes a search for a match in a specified string and returns a result array, or null instead of returning true/false.

     ```javascript
     var pattern = /you/;
     console.log(pattern.exec("How are you?")); //["you", index: 8, input: "How are you?", groups: undefined]
     ```

161. ### How do you change the style of a HTML element

     You can change inline style or classname of a HTML element using javascript DOM-manipulation

     1. **Using style property:** You can modify inline style using style property

     ```javascript
     document.getElementById("title").style.fontSize = "30px";
     ```

     2. **Using ClassName property:** It is easy to modify element class using className property

     ```javascript
     document.getElementById("title").className = "custom-title";
     ```

162. ### What would be the result of 1+2+'3'

     The output is going to be `33`. Since `1` and `2` are numeric values, the result of the first two digits is going to be a numeric value `3`. The next digit is a string type value because of that the addition of numeric value `3` and string type value `3` is just going to be a concatenation value `33`. Other operationrs like `3 * '3'` do yield correct results because the string is coerced into a number.

163. ### What is a debugger statement

     The debugger statement invokes any available debugging functionality, such as setting a breakpoint. If no debugging functionality is available, this statement has no effect.
     For example, in the below function a debugger statement has been inserted. So
     execution is paused at the debugger statement just like a breakpoint in the script source.

     ```javascript
     function getProfile() {
       // code goes here
       debugger;
       // code goes here
     }
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

164. ### What is the purpose of breakpoints in debugging

     You can set breakpoints in the javascript code once the debugger statement is executed and the debugger window pops up. At each breakpoint, javascript will stop executing, and let you examine the JavaScript values. After examining values, you can resume the execution of code using the play button.

165. ### Can I use reserved words as identifiers

     No, you cannot use the reserved words as variables, labels, object or function names. Let's see one simple example,

     ```javascript
     var else = "hello"; // Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token else
     ```

166. ### How do you detect a mobile browser

     You can use regex which returns a true or false value depending on whether or not the user is browsing with a mobile.

     ```javascript
     window.mobilecheck = function () {
       var mobileCheck = false;
       (function (a) {
         if (

167. ### How do you detect a mobile browser without regexp

     You can detect mobile browsers by simply running through a list of devices and checking if the useragent matches anything. This is an alternative solution for RegExp usage,

     ```javascript
     function detectmob() {
       if (
         navigator.userAgent.match(/Android/i) ||
         navigator.userAgent.match(/webOS/i) ||
         navigator.userAgent.match(/iPhone/i) ||
         navigator.userAgent.match(/iPad/i) ||
         navigator.userAgent.match(/iPod/i) ||
         navigator.userAgent.match(/BlackBerry/i) ||
         navigator.userAgent.match(/Windows Phone/i)
       ) {
         return true;
       } else {
         return false;
       }
     }
     ```

168. ### How do you get the image width and height using JS

     You can programmatically get the image and check the dimensions(width and height) using Javascript.

     ```javascript
     var img = new Image();
     img.onload = function () {
       console.log(this.width + "x" + this.height);
     };
     img.src = "http://www.google.com/intl/en_ALL/images/logo.gif";
     ```

169. ### How do you make synchronous HTTP request

     Browsers provide an XMLHttpRequest object which can be used to make synchronous HTTP requests from JavaScript.

     ```javascript
     function httpGet(theUrl) {
       var xmlHttpReq = new XMLHttpRequest();
       xmlHttpReq.open("GET", theUrl, false); // false for synchronous request
       xmlHttpReq.send(null);
       return xmlHttpReq.responseText;
     }
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

170. ### How do you make asynchronous HTTP request

     Browsers provide an XMLHttpRequest object which can be used to make asynchronous HTTP requests from JavaScript by passing the 3rd parameter as true.

     ```javascript
     function httpGetAsync(theUrl, callback) {
       var xmlHttpReq = new XMLHttpRequest();
       xmlHttpReq.onreadystatechange = function () {
         if (xmlHttpReq.readyState == 4 && xmlHttpReq.status == 200) callback(xmlHttpReq.responseText);
       };
       xmlHttpReq.open("GET", theUrl, true); // true for asynchronous
       xmlHttpReq.send(null);
     }
     ```

     Today this is considered deprecated, because an async `fetch` call (in browsers later than 2016) is simpler and more robust.

171. ### How do you convert date to another timezone in javascript

     You can use the toLocaleString() method to convert dates in one timezone to another. For example, let's convert current date to British English timezone as below,

     ```javascript
     console.log(new Date().toLocaleString("en-GB", { timeZone: "UTC" })); //29/06/2019, 09:56:00
     ```

172. ### What are the properties used to get size of window

     You can use innerWidth, innerHeight, clientWidth, clientHeight properties of windows, document element and document body objects to find the size of a window. Let's use them combination of these properties to calculate the size of a window or document,

     ```javascript
     var width = window.innerWidth || document.documentElement.clientWidth || document.body.clientWidth;

     var height = window.innerHeight || document.documentElement.clientHeight || document.body.clientHeight;
     ```

173. ### What is a conditional operator in javascript

     The conditional (ternary) operator is the only JavaScript operator that takes three operands which acts as a shortcut for `if` statements.

     ```javascript
     var isAuthenticated = false;
     console.log(isAuthenticated ? "Hello, welcome" : "Sorry, you are not authenticated"); // Sorry, you are not authenticated
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

174. ### Can you apply chaining on conditional operator

     Yes, you can apply chaining on conditional operators similar to **`if … else if … else if … else`** chain. The syntax is going to be as below,

     ```javascript
     function traceValue(someParam) {
       return condition1 ? value1 : condition2 ? value2 : condition3 ? value3 : value4;
     }

     // The above conditional operator is equivalent to:

     function traceValue(someParam) {
       if (condition1) {
         return value1;
       } else if (condition2) {
         return value2;
       } else if (condition3) {
         return value3;
       } else {
         return value4;
       }
     }
     ```

175. ### What are the ways to execute javascript after a page load

     You can execute javascript after page load in many different ways,

     1. **window.onload:**

     ```javascript
     window.onload = function ...
     ```

     2. **document.onload:**

     ```javascript
     document.onload = function ...
     ```

     3. **body onload:**

     ```javascript
     <body onload="script();">
     ```

176. ### What is the difference between proto and prototype

     The `__proto__` object is the actual object that is used in the lookup chain to resolve methods, etc. Whereas `prototype` is the object that is used to build `__proto__` when you create an object with the `new` operator (a special variant of a function call).

     ```javascript
     new Employee().__proto__ === Employee.prototype;
     new Employee().prototype === undefined;
     ```

     There are few more differences,

     | feature    | Prototype                                                    | proto                                                      |
     | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
     | Access     | All function constructors have prototype properties.         | All objects have \_\_proto\_\_ property                    |
     | Purpose    | Used to reduce memory wastage with a single copy of function | Used in lookup chain to resolve methods, constructors etc. |
     | ECMAScript | Introduced in ES6                                            | Introduced in ES5                                          |
     | Usage      | Frequently used                                              | Rarely used                                                |

177. ### Can you give an example of when you really need a semicolon

     It is recommended to use semicolons after every statement in JavaScript. For example, in the below case (that is an IIFE = Immediately Invoked Function Expression) it throws an error ".. is not a function" at runtime due to missing semicolon.

     ```javascript
     // define a function
     var fn = (function () {
       //...
     })(
       // semicolon missing at this line

       // then execute some code inside a closure
       function () {
         //...
       }
     )();
     ```

     and it will be interpreted as

     ```javascript
     var fn = (function () {
       //...
     })(function () {
       //...
     })();
     ```

     In this case, we are passing the second function as an argument to the first function and then trying to call the result of the first function call as a function. Hence, the second function will fail with a "... is not a function" error at runtime.

178. ### What is the freeze method

     The **`freeze()`** method is used to freeze an object. Freezing an object does not allow adding new properties to an object, prevents removing, and prevents changing the enumerability, configurability, or writability of existing properties. i.e. It returns the passed object and does not create a frozen copy.

     ```javascript
     const obj = {
       prop: 100,
     };

     Object.freeze(obj);
     obj.prop = 200; // Throws an error in strict mode

     console.log(obj.prop); //100
     ```

     Remember freezing is only applied to the top-level properties in objects but not for nested objects.
     For example, let's try to freeze user object which has employment details as nested object and observe that details have been changed.

     ```javascript
     const user = {
       name: "John",
       employment: {
         department: "IT",
       },
     };

     Object.freeze(user);
     user.employment.department = "HR";
     ```

     **Note:** It causes a TypeError if the argument passed is not an object.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

179. ### What is the purpose of the freeze method

     Below are the main benefits of using freeze method,

     1. It is used for freezing objects and arrays.
     2. It is used to make an object immutable.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

180. ### Why do I need to use the freeze method

     In the Object-oriented paradigm, an existing API contains certain elements that are not intended to be extended, modified, or re-used outside of their current context. Hence it works as the `final` keyword which is used in various languages.

     You can use the navigator object to detect a browser language preference as below,

     ```javascript
     var language =
       (navigator.languages && navigator.languages[0]) || // Chrome / Firefox
       navigator.language || // All browsers
       navigator.userLanguage; // IE <= 10

     console.log(language);

182. ### How to convert a string to title case with javascript

     Title case means that the first letter of each word is capitalized. You can convert a string to title case using the below function,

     ```javascript
     function toTitleCase(str) {
       return str.replace(/\w\S*/g, function (txt) {
         return txt.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + txt.substring(1).toLowerCase();
       });
     }
     toTitleCase("good morning john"); // Good Morning John
     ```

183. ### How do you detect if javascript is disabled on the page

     You can use the `<noscript>` tag to detect javascript disabled or not. The code block inside `<noscript>` gets executed when JavaScript is disabled, and is typically used to display alternative content when the page generated in JavaScript.

     ```javascript
     <script type="javascript">
         // JS related code goes here
     </script>

184. ### What are various operators supported by javascript

     An operator is capable of manipulating(mathematical and logical computations) a certain value or operand. There are various operators supported by JavaScript as below,

     1. **Arithmetic Operators:** Includes + (Addition), – (Subtraction), \* (Multiplication), / (Division), % (Modulus), ++ (Increment) and – – (Decrement)
     2. **Comparison Operators:** Includes == (Equal), != (Not Equal), === (Equal with type), > (Greater than), >= (Greater than or Equal to), < (Less than), <= (Less than or Equal to)
     3. **Logical Operators:** Includes && (Logical AND), || (Logical OR), ! (Logical NOT)
     4. **Assignment Operators:** Includes = (Assignment Operator), += (Add and Assignment Operator), –= (Subtract and Assignment Operator), \*= (Multiply and Assignment), /= (Divide and Assignment), %= (Modules and Assignment)
     5. **Ternary Operators:** It includes conditional(: ?) Operator
     6. **typeof Operator:** It uses to find type of variable. The syntax looks like `typeof variable`

185. ### What is a rest parameter

     Rest parameter is an improved way to handle function parameters which allows us to represent an indefinite number of arguments as an array. The syntax would be as below,

     ```javascript
     function f(a, b, ...theArgs) {
       // ...
     }
     ```

     For example, let's take a sum example to calculate on dynamic number of parameters,

     ```javascript
     function sum(...args) {
       let total = 0;
       for (const i of args) {
         total += i;
       }
       return total;
     }

     console.log(sum(1, 2)); //3
     console.log(sum(1, 2, 3)); //6
     console.log(sum(1, 2, 3, 4)); //10
     console.log(sum(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)); //15
     ```

     **Note:** Rest parameter is added in ES2015 or ES6

186. ### What happens if you do not use rest parameter as a last argument

     The rest parameter should be the last argument, as its job is to collect all the remaining arguments into an array. For example, if you define a function like below it doesn’t make any sense and will throw an error.

     ```javascript
     function someFunc(a,…b,c){
     //You code goes here
     return;
     }
     ```

187. ### What are the bitwise operators available in javascript

     Below are the list of bitwise logical operators used in JavaScript

     1. Bitwise AND ( & )
     2. Bitwise OR ( | )
     3. Bitwise XOR ( ^ )
     4. Bitwise NOT ( ~ )
     5. Left Shift ( << )
     6. Sign Propagating Right Shift ( >> )
     7. Zero fill Right Shift ( >>> )

188. ### What is a spread operator

     Spread operator allows iterables( arrays / objects / strings ) to be expanded into single arguments/elements. Let's take an example to see this behavior,

     ```javascript
     function calculateSum(x, y, z) {
       return x + y + z;
     }

     const numbers = [1, 2, 3];

     console.log(calculateSum(...numbers)); // 6
     ```

189. ### How do you determine whether object is frozen or not

     `Object.isFrozen()` method is used to determine if an object is frozen or not.An object is frozen if all of the below conditions hold true,

     1. If it is not extensible.
     2. If all of its properties are non-configurable.
     3. If all its data properties are non-writable.
        The usage is going to be as follows,

     ```javascript
     const object = {
       property: "Welcome JS world",
     };
     Object.freeze(object);
     console.log(Object.isFrozen(object));
     ```

190. ### How do you determine two values same or not using object

     The `Object.is()` method determines whether two values are the same value. For example, the usage with different types of values would be,

     ```javascript
     Object.is("hello", "hello"); // true
     Object.is(window, window); // true
     Object.is([], []); // false
     ```

     Two values are considered identical if one of the following holds:

     1. both undefined
     2. both null
     3. both true or both false
     4. both strings of the same length with the same characters in the same order
     5. both the same object (means both object have same reference)
     6. both numbers and
        both +0
        both -0
        both NaN
        both non-zero and both not NaN and both have the same value.

191. ### What is the purpose of using object is method

     Some of the applications of Object's `is` method are follows,

     1. It is used for comparison of two strings.
     2. It is used for comparison of two numbers.
     3. It is used for comparing the polarity of two numbers.
     4. It is used for comparison of two objects.

192. ### How do you copy properties from one object to other

     You can use the `Object.assign()` method which is used to copy the values and properties from one or more source objects to a target object. It returns the target object which has properties and values copied from the source objects. The syntax would be as below,

     ```javascript
     Object.assign(target, ...sources);
     ```

     Let's take example with one source and one target object,

     ```javascript
     const target = { a: 1, b: 2 };
     const source = { b: 3, c: 4 };

     const returnedTarget = Object.assign(target, source);

     console.log(target); // { a: 1, b: 3, c: 4 }

     console.log(returnedTarget); // { a: 1, b: 3, c: 4 }
     ```

     As observed in the above code, there is a common property(`b`) from source to target so it's value has been overwritten.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

193. ### What are the applications of the assign method

     Below are the some of main applications of `Object.assign()` method,

     1. It is used for cloning an object.
     2. It is used to merge objects with the same properties.

194. ### What is a proxy object

     The Proxy object is used to define custom behavior for fundamental operations such as property lookup, assignment, enumeration, function invocation, etc.

     A proxy is created with two parameters: a target object which you want to proxy and a handler object which contains methods to intercept fundamental operations. The syntax would be as follows,

     ```javascript
     var p = new Proxy(target, handler);
     ```

     Let's take a look at below examples of proxy object and how the get method which customize the lookup behavior,

     ```javascript
     //Example1:

     const person = {
       name: "Sudheer Jonna",
       age: 35,
     };

     const handler = {
       get(target, prop) {
         if (prop === "name") {
           return "Mr. " + target[prop];
         }
         return target[prop];
       },
     };

     const proxy = new Proxy(person, handler);

     //Example2:

     var handler1 = {
       get: function (obj, prop) {
         return prop in obj ? obj[prop] : 100;
       },
     };

     var p = new Proxy({}, handler1);
     p.a = 10;
     p.b = null;

     console.log(p.a, p.b); // 10, null
     console.log("c" in p, p.c); // false, 100
     ```

     In the above code, it uses `get` handler which define the behavior of the proxy when an operation is performed on it. These proxies are mainly used for some of the below cross-cutting concerns.

     1. Logging
     2. Authentication or Authorization
     3. Data binding and observables
     4. Function parameter validation

     **Note:** This feature was introduced with ES6.

195. ### What is the purpose of the seal method

     The `Object.seal()` method is used to seal an object, by preventing new properties from being added to it and marking all existing properties as non-configurable. But **values of present properties can still be changed as long as they are writable**. The next level of immutability would be the [`Object.freeze()`](#what-is-a-freeze-method) method. Let's see the below example to understand more about `seal()` method

     ```javascript
     const object = {
       property: "Welcome JS world",
     };
     Object.seal(object);
     object.property = "Welcome to object world";
     console.log(Object.isSealed(object)); // true
     delete object.property; // You cannot delete when sealed
     console.log(object.property); //Welcome to object world
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

196. ### What are the applications of the seal method

     Below are the main applications of `Object.seal()` method,

     1. It is used for sealing objects and arrays.
     2. It is used to make properties of an object non-configurable.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

197. ### What are the differences between the freeze and seal methods

     If an object is frozen using the `Object.freeze()` method then its properties become immutable and no changes can be made in them whereas if an object is sealed using the `Object.seal()` method then the changes can be made in the existing properties of the object.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

198. ### How do you determine if an object is sealed or not

     The `Object.isSealed()` method is used to determine if an object is sealed or not. An object is sealed if all of the below conditions hold true

     1. If it is not extensible.
     2. If all of its properties are non-configurable.
     3. If it is not removable (but not necessarily non-writable).
        Let's see it in the action

     ```javascript
     const object = {
       property: "Hello, Good morning",
     };

     Object.seal(object); // Using seal() method to seal the object

     console.log(Object.isSealed(object)); // checking whether the object is sealed or not
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

199. ### How do you get enumerable key and value pairs

     The `Object.entries()` method is used to return an array of a given object's own enumerable string-keyed property [key, value] pairs, in the same order as that provided by a `for...in` loop. Let's see the functionality of `object.entries()` method in an example,

     ```javascript
     const object = {
       a: "Good morning",
       b: 100,
     };

     for (let [key, value] of Object.entries(object)) {
       console.log(`${key}: ${value}`); // a: 'Good morning'
       // b: 100
     }
     ```

     **Note:** The order is not guaranteed as object defined.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

200. ### What is the main difference between Object.values and Object.entries method

     The `Object.values()` method's behavior is similar to `Object.entries()` method but it returns an array of values instead [key,value] pairs.

     ```javascript
     const object = {
       a: "Good morning",
       b: 100,
     };

     for (let value of Object.values(object)) {
       console.log(`${value}`); // 'Good morning \n100'
     }
     ```
