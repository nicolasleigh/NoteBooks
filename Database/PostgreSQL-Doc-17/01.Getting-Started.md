To create a new database, in this example named `mydb`, you use the following command:

```sh
$ createdb mydb
```

If you are the owner (creator) of the database `mydb`, you can destroy it using the following command:

```sh
$ dropdb mydb
```

Using `psql` command to connect `mydb` database. If you do not supply the database name then it will default to your user account name:

```sh
$ psql mydb
```

When your prompt becomes `mydb=#`, this would mean you are a database superuser, which is most likely the case if you installed the PostgreSQL instance yourself. Being a superuser means that you are not subject to access controls.

Try out some commands:

```sh
mydb=> SELECT version();

mydb=> SELECT current_date;

mydb=> SELECT 2 + 2;
```

The `psql` program has a number of internal commands that are not SQL commands. They begin with the backslash character, “`\`”. For example, you can get help on the syntax of various PostgreSQL SQL commands by typing: 

```sh
mydb=> \h
```

To get out of psql, type: 

```sh
mydb=> \q
```

For more internal commands, type `\?` at the `psql` prompt.
