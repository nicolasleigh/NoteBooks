## Data Definition

### Default Values

The default value can be an expression, which will be evaluated whenever the default value is inserted (not when the table is created). A common example is for a `timestamp` column to have a default of `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`, so that it gets set to the time of row insertion. Another common example is generating a “serial number” for each row. In PostgreSQL this is typically done by something like:

```sql
CREATE TABLE products (   
	product_no integer DEFAULT nextval('products_product_no_seq'),    
  ...
);
```

where the `nextval()` function supplies successive values from a sequence object (see Section 9.17). This arrangement is sufficiently common that there's a special shorthand for it:

```sql
CREATE TABLE products (  
  product_no SERIAL,   
  ...
);
```

### Identity Columns

An identity column is a special column that is generated automatically from an implicit sequence. It can be used to generate key values.

To create an identity column, use the `GENERATED ... AS IDENTITY` clause in `CREATE TABLE`, for example:

```sql
CREATE TABLE people (  
  id bigint GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY,  
  ...,
);
```

or alternatively

```sql
CREATE TABLE people ( 
  id bigint GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY,  
  ..., 
);
```

Alternatively, the keyword `DEFAULT` can be specified in place of a value to explicitly request the sequence-generated value, like

```sql
INSERT INTO people (id, name, address) VALUE (DEFAULT, 'C', 'baz');
```

Similarly, the keyword `DEFAULT` can be used in `UPDATE` commands.

Thus, in many ways, an identity column behaves like a column with a default value.

The clauses `ALWAYS` and `BY DEFAULT` in the column definition determine how explicitly user-specified values are handled in `INSERT` and `UPDATE` commands. In an `INSERT` command, if `ALWAYS` is selected, a user-specified value is only accepted if the INSERT statement specifies `OVERRIDING SYSTEM VALUE`. If `BY DEFAULT` is selected, then the user-specified value takes precedence. Thus, using `BY DEFAULT` results in a behavior more similar to default values, where the default value can be overridden by an explicit value, whereas `ALWAYS` provides some more protection against accidentally inserting an explicit value.

An identity column is automatically marked as `NOT NULL`. An identity column, however, does not guarantee uniqueness. (A sequence normally returns unique values, but a sequence could be reset, or values could be inserted manually into the identity column, as discussed above.) Uniqueness would need to be enforced using a `PRIMARY KEY` or `UNIQUE` constraint.

### Generated Columns

A generated column is a special column that is always computed from other columns. Thus, it is for columns what a view is for tables. There are two kinds of generated columns: stored and virtual. A stored generated column is computed when it is written (inserted or updated) and occupies storage as if it were a normal column. A virtual generated column occupies no storage and is computed when it is read. Thus, a virtual generated column is similar to a view and a stored generated column is similar to a materialized view (except that it is always updated automatically). PostgreSQL currently implements only stored generated columns.

To create a generated column, use the `GENERATED ALWAYS AS` clause in `CREATE TABLE`, for example:

```sql
CREATE TABLE people (   
  ...,   
  height_cm numeric,  
  height_in numeric GENERATED ALWAYS AS (height_cm / 2.54) STORED 
);
```

The keyword `STORED` must be specified to choose the stored kind of generated column.

A generated column cannot be written to directly. In `INSERT` or `UPDATE` commands, a value cannot be specified for a generated column, but the keyword `DEFAULT` may be specified.

Consider the differences between a column with a default and a generated column. The column default is evaluated once when the row is first inserted if no other value was provided; a generated column is updated whenever the row changes and cannot be overridden. A column default may not refer to other columns of the table; a generation expression would normally do so. A column default can use volatile functions, for example `random()` or functions referring to the current time; this is not allowed for generated columns.

### Constraints

#### Check Constraints

A check constraint is the most generic constraint type. It allows you to specify that the value in a certain column must satisfy a Boolean (truth-value) expression. For instance, to require positive product prices, you could use:

```sql
CREATE TABLE products (   
  product_no integer,   
  name text,   
  price numeric CHECK (price > 0) 
);
```

As you see, the constraint definition comes after the data type, just like default value definitions. Default values and constraints can be listed in any order. A check constraint consists of the key word `CHECK` followed by an expression in parentheses. The check constraint expression should involve the column thus constrained, otherwise the constraint would not make too much sense.

You can also give the constraint a separate name. This clarifies error messages and allows you to refer to the constraint when you need to change it. The syntax is:

```sql
CREATE TABLE products (   
  product_no integer,   
  name text,   
  price numeric CONSTRAINT positive_price CHECK (price > 0)
);
```

So, to specify a named constraint, use the key word `CONSTRAINT` followed by an identifier followed by the constraint definition. (If you don't specify a constraint name in this way, the system chooses a name for you.)

A check constraint can also refer to several columns.

```sql
CREATE TABLE products (  
  product_no integer,  
  name text,   
  price numeric CHECK (price > 0), 
  discounted_price numeric CHECK (discounted_price > 0), 
  CHECK (price > discounted_price) 
);
```

We say that the first two constraints are column constraints, whereas the third one is a table constraint because it is written separately from any one column definition.

#### Not-Null Constraints

A not-null constraint is always written as a column constraint. A not-null constraint is functionally equivalent to creating a check constraint `CHECK (column_name IS NOT NULL)`, but in PostgreSQL creating an explicit not-null constraint is more efficient. The drawback is that you cannot give explicit names to not-null constraints created this way.

#### Unique Constraints

When written as a column constraint:

```sql
CREATE TABLE products (  
  product_no integer UNIQUE, 
  name text,  
  price numeric
);
```

When written as a table constraint:

```sql
CREATE TABLE products (   
  product_no integer,  
  name text,   
  price numeric,  
  UNIQUE (product_no)
);
```

To define a unique constraint for a group of columns:

```sql
CREATE TABLE example (  
  a integer,  
  b integer,  
  c integer,  
  UNIQUE (a, c) 
);
```

This specifies that the combination of values in the indicated columns is unique across the whole table, though any one of the columns need not be (and ordinarily isn't) unique.

You can assign your own name for a unique constraint, in the usual way:

```sql
CREATE TABLE products ( 
  product_no integer CONSTRAINT must_be_different UNIQUE, 
  name text,   
  price numeric 
);
```

Adding a unique constraint will automatically create a unique B-tree index on the column or group of columns listed in the constraint.

In general, a unique constraint is violated if there is more than one row in the table where the values of all of the columns included in the constraint are equal. By default, two null values are not considered equal in this comparison. That means even in the presence of a unique constraint it is possible to store duplicate rows that contain a null value in at least one of the constrained columns. This behavior can be changed by adding the clause `NULLS NOT DISTINCT`, like

```sql
CREATE TABLE products (  
  product_no integer UNIQUE NULLS NOT DISTINCT,   
  name text,  
  price numeric 
);
```

or:

```sql
CREATE TABLE products (   
  product_no integer,  
  name text,   
  price numeric,  
  UNIQUE NULLS NOT DISTINCT (product_no)
);
```

The default behavior can be specified explicitly using `NULLS DISTINCT`.

#### Primary Keys

A primary key constraint indicates that a column, or group of columns, can be used as a unique identifier for rows in the table. This requires that the values be both unique and not null. So, the following two table definitions accept the same data:

```sql
CREATE TABLE products (   
  product_no integer UNIQUE NOT NULL, 
  name text,   
  price numeric
);

CREATE TABLE products (  
  product_no integer PRIMARY KEY,  
  name text,    
  price numeric 
);
```

Primary keys can span more than one column; the syntax is similar to unique constraints:

```sql
CREATE TABLE example ( 
  a integer,   
  b integer,  
  c integer,  
  PRIMARY KEY (a, c)
);
```

Adding a primary key will automatically create a unique B-tree index on the column or group of columns listed in the primary key, and will force the column(s) to be marked `NOT NULL`.

A table can have at most one primary key. (There can be any number of unique and not-null constraints, which are functionally almost the same thing, but only one can be identified as the primary key.) Relational database theory dictates that every table must have a primary key. This rule is not enforced by PostgreSQL, but it is usually best to follow it.

#### Foreign Keys

A foreign key constraint specifies that the values in a column (or a group of columns) must match the values appearing in some row of another table. We say this maintains the **referential integrity** between two related tables.

The same product table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE products (   
  product_no integer PRIMARY KEY,  
  name text,   
  price numeric
);
```

Define a foreign key constraint:

```sql
CREATE TABLE orders (  
  order_id integer PRIMARY KEY,   
  product_no integer REFERENCES products (product_no),  
  quantity integer 
);
```

We say that in this situation the orders table is the **referencing** table and the products table is the **referenced** table. Similarly, there are referencing and referenced columns.

You can also shorten the above command to:

```sql
CREATE TABLE orders ( 
  order_id integer PRIMARY KEY, 
  product_no integer REFERENCES products,  
  quantity integer 
);
```

because in absence of a column list the primary key of the referenced table is used as the referenced column(s).

A foreign key can also constrain and reference a group of columns. As usual, it then needs to be written in table constraint form. Here is a contrived syntax example:

```sql
CREATE TABLE t1 ( 
  a integer PRIMARY KEY, 
  b integer,  
  c integer, 
  FOREIGN KEY (b, c) REFERENCES other_table (c1, c2)
);
```

A table can have more than one foreign key constraint. This is used to implement many-to-many relationships between tables. Say you have tables about products and orders, but now you want to allow one order to contain possibly many products (which the structure above did not allow). You could use this table structure:

```sql
CREATE TABLE products (   
  product_no integer PRIMARY KEY,  
  name text,   
  price numeric 
);

CREATE TABLE orders (  
  order_id integer PRIMARY KEY,   
  shipping_address text,   
  ...
); 

CREATE TABLE order_items (  
  product_no integer REFERENCES products,  
  order_id integer REFERENCES orders, 
  quantity integer,  
  PRIMARY KEY (product_no, order_id) 
);
```

Notice that the primary key overlaps with the foreign keys in the last table.

We know that the foreign keys disallow creation of orders that do not relate to any products. But what if a product is removed after an order is created that references it? SQL allows you to handle that as well. Intuitively, we have a few options: 

- Disallow deleting a referenced product 
- Delete the orders as well 
- Something else?

To illustrate this, let's implement the following policy on the many-to-many relationship example above: when someone wants to remove a product that is still referenced by an order (via `order_items`), we disallow it. If someone removes an order, the order items are removed as well:

```sql
CREATE TABLE products (  
  product_no integer PRIMARY KEY,  
  name text,  
  price numeric
);

CREATE TABLE orders ( 
  order_id integer PRIMARY KEY, 
  shipping_address text,   
  ...
); 

CREATE TABLE order_items ( 
  product_no integer REFERENCES products ON DELETE RESTRICT, 
  order_id integer REFERENCES orders ON DELETE CASCADE,  
  quantity integer,   
  PRIMARY KEY (product_no, order_id) 
);
```

Restricting and cascading deletes are the two most common options. `RESTRICT` prevents deletion of a referenced row. `NO ACTION` means that if any referencing rows still exist when the constraint is checked, an error is raised; this is the default behavior if you do not specify anything. (The essential difference between these two choices is that `NO ACTION` allows the check to be deferred until later in the transaction, whereas `RESTRICT` does not.) `CASCADE` specifies that when a referenced row is deleted, row(s) referencing it should be automatically deleted as well. There are two other options: `SET NULL` and `SET DEFAULT`. These cause the referencing column(s) in the referencing row(s) to be set to nulls or their default values, respectively, when the referenced row is deleted. Note that these do not excuse you from observing any constraints. For example, if an action specifies `SET DEFAULT` but the default value would not satisfy the foreign key constraint, the operation will fail.

The appropriate choice of `ON DELETE` action depends on what kinds of objects the related tables represent. When the referencing table represents something that is a component of what is represented by the referenced table and cannot exist independently, then `CASCADE` could be appropriate. If the two tables represent independent objects, then `RESTRICT` or `NO ACTION` is more appropriate; an application that actually wants to delete both objects would then have to be explicit about this and run two delete commands. In the above example, order items are part of an order, and it is convenient if they are deleted automatically if an order is deleted. But products and orders are different things, and so making a deletion of a product automatically cause the deletion of some order items could be considered problematic. The actions `SET NULL` or `SET DEFAULT` can be appropriate if a foreign-key relationship represents optional information. For example, if the products table contained a reference to a product manager, and the product manager entry gets deleted, then setting the product's product manager to null or a default might be useful.

The actions `SET NULL` and `SET DEFAULT` can take a column list to specify which columns to set. Normally, all columns of the foreign-key constraint are set; setting only a subset is useful in some special cases. Consider the following example:

```sql
CREATE TABLE tenants (  
  tenant_id integer PRIMARY KEY 
);

CREATE TABLE users (  
  tenant_id integer REFERENCES tenants ON DELETE CASCADE,  
  user_id integer NOT NULL,  
  PRIMARY KEY (tenant_id, user_id)
); 

CREATE TABLE posts (   
  tenant_id integer REFERENCES tenants ON DELETE CASCADE,  
  post_id integer NOT NULL,  
  author_id integer,   
  PRIMARY KEY (tenant_id, post_id),  
  FOREIGN KEY (tenant_id, author_id) REFERENCES users ON DELETE SET NULL (author_id) 
);
```

Without the specification of the column, the foreign key would also set the column `tenant_id` to null, but that column is still required as part of the primary key.

Analogous to `ON DELETE` there is also `ON UPDATE` which is invoked when a referenced column is changed (updated). The possible actions are the same, except that column lists cannot be specified for `SET NULL` and `SET DEFAULT`. In this case, `CASCADE` means that the updated values of the referenced column(s) should be copied into the referencing row(s).

A foreign key must reference columns that either are a primary key or form a unique constraint, or are columns from a non-partial unique index. This means that the referenced columns always have an index to allow efficient lookups on whether a referencing row has a match. Since a `DELETE` of a row from the referenced table or an `UPDATE` of a referenced column will require a scan of the referencing table for rows matching the old value, it is often a good idea to index the referencing columns too. Because this is not always needed, and there are many choices available on how to index, the declaration of a foreign key constraint does not automatically create an index on the referencing columns.
