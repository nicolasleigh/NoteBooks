Tables are grouped into databases, and a collection of databases managed by a single PostgreSQL server instance constitutes a database **cluster**.

SQL is **case-insensitive** about **key words** and **identifiers**, except when identifiers are **double-quoted** to preserve the case.

```postgresql
CREATE TABLE weather (
    city            varchar(80),
    temp_lo         int,           -- low temperature
    temp_hi         int,           -- high temperature
    prcp            real,          -- precipitation
    date            date
);
```

`varchar(80)` specifies a data type that can store arbitrary character strings up to 80 characters in length. `int` is the normal integer type. `real` is a type for storing single precision floating-point numbers. `date` should be self-explanatory.

```postgresql
CREATE TABLE cities (
    name            varchar(80),
    location        point
);
```

The `point` type is an example of a PostgreSQL-specific data type.

```postgresql
INSERT INTO weather VALUES ('San Francisco', 46, 50, 0.25, '1994-11-27');
```

Constants that are not simple numeric values usually must be surrounded by single quotes (`'`), as in the example.

The `point` type requires a coordinate pair as input, as shown here:

```postgresql
INSERT INTO cities VALUES ('San Francisco', '(-194.0, 53.0)');
```

The syntax used so far requires you to remember the order of the columns. An alternative syntax allows you to list the columns explicitly:

```postgresql
INSERT INTO weather (city, temp_lo, temp_hi, prcp, date)
    VALUES ('San Francisco', 43, 57, 0.0, '1994-11-29');
```

You can list the columns in a different order if you wish or even omit some columns, e.g., if the precipitation is unknown:

```postgresql
INSERT INTO weather (date, city, temp_hi, temp_lo)
    VALUES ('1994-11-29', 'Hayward', 54, 37);
```

You could also have used `COPY` to load large amounts of data from flat-text files:

```postgresql
COPY weather FROM '/home/user/weather.txt';
```

```postgresql
SELECT * FROM weather;

SELECT city, temp_lo, temp_hi, prcp, date FROM weather;
```

```postgresql
SELECT city, (temp_hi+temp_lo)/2 AS temp_avg, date FROM weather;
```

```
     city      | temp_avg |    date
---------------+----------+------------
 San Francisco |       48 | 1994-11-27
 San Francisco |       50 | 1994-11-29
 Hayward       |       45 | 1994-11-29
(3 rows)
```

While `SELECT *` is useful for off-the-cuff queries, it is widely considered bad style in production code, since adding a column to the table would change the results.

```postgresql
SELECT DISTINCT city     
	FROM weather     
	ORDER BY city;
```

```
     city
---------------
 Hayward
 San Francisco
(2 rows)
```

In some database systems, including older versions of PostgreSQL, the implementation of `DISTINCT` automatically orders the rows and so `ORDER BY` is unnecessary. But this is not required by the SQL standard, and current PostgreSQL does not guarantee that `DISTINCT` causes the rows to be ordered.

Queries that access multiple tables (or multiple instances of the same table) at one time are called **join** queries.

```postgresql
SELECT * FROM weather JOIN cities ON city = name;
```

```
     city      | temp_lo | temp_hi | prcp |    date    |     name      | location
---------------+---------+---------+------+------------+---------------+-----------
 San Francisco |      46 |      50 | 0.25 | 1994-11-27 | San Francisco | (-194,53)
 San Francisco |      43 |      57 |    0 | 1994-11-29 | San Francisco | (-194,53)
(2 rows)
```

There are two columns containing the city name. This is correct because the lists of columns from the weather and cities tables are concatenated. In practice this is undesirable, though, so you will probably want to list the output columns explicitly rather than using `*`:

```postgresql
SELECT city, temp_lo, temp_hi, prcp, date, location     
	FROM weather JOIN cities ON city = name;
```

```
     city      | temp_lo | temp_hi | prcp |    date    | location
---------------+---------+---------+------+------------+-----------
 San Francisco |      46 |      50 | 0.25 | 1994-11-27 | (-194,53)
 San Francisco |      43 |      57 |    0 | 1994-11-29 | (-194,53)
(2 rows)
```

Since the columns all had different names, the parser automatically found which table they belong to. If there were duplicate column names in the two tables you'd need to **qualify** the column names to show which one you meant, as in:

```postgresql
SELECT weather.city, weather.temp_lo, weather.temp_hi, 
			weather.prcp, weather.date, cities.location     
	FROM weather JOIN cities ON weather.city = cities.name;
```

```
     city      | temp_lo | temp_hi | prcp |    date    | location
---------------+---------+---------+------+------------+-----------
 San Francisco |      46 |      50 | 0.25 | 1994-11-27 | (-194,53)
 San Francisco |      43 |      57 |    0 | 1994-11-29 | (-194,53)
(2 rows)
```

It is widely considered good style to qualify all column names in a join query, so that the query won't fail if a duplicate column name is later added to one of the tables. 

Join queries of the kind seen thus far can also be written in this form:

```postgresql
SELECT *     
	FROM weather, cities     
	WHERE city = name;
```

```
     city      | temp_lo | temp_hi | prcp |    date    |     name      | location
---------------+---------+---------+------+------------+---------------+-----------
 San Francisco |      46 |      50 | 0.25 | 1994-11-27 | San Francisco | (-194,53)
 San Francisco |      43 |      57 |    0 | 1994-11-29 | San Francisco | (-194,53)
(2 rows)
```

This syntax pre-dates the `JOIN/ON` syntax. The tables are simply listed in the `FROM` clause, and the comparison expression is added to the `WHERE` clause. The results from this older implicit syntax and the newer explicit `JOIN/ON` syntax are identical. But for a reader of the query, the explicit syntax makes its meaning easier to understand: The join condition is introduced by its own key word whereas previously the condition was mixed into the `WHERE` clause together with other conditions.

```postgresql
SELECT *     
	FROM weather LEFT OUTER JOIN cities ON weather.city = cities.name;
```

```
     city      | temp_lo | temp_hi | prcp |    date    |     name      | location
---------------+---------+---------+------+------------+---------------+-----------
 San Francisco |      46 |      50 | 0.25 | 1994-11-27 | San Francisco | (-194,53)
 San Francisco |      43 |      57 |    0 | 1994-11-29 | San Francisco | (-194,53)
 Hayward       |      37 |      54 |      | 1994-11-29 |               |
(3 rows)
```

This query is called a **left outer join** because the table mentioned on the left of the join operator will have each of its rows in the output at least once, whereas the table on the right will only have those rows output that match some row of the left table. When outputting a left-table row for which there is no right-table match, empty (`null`) values are substituted for the right-table columns.

We can also join a table against itself. This is called a **self join**. As an example, suppose we wish to find all the weather records that are in the temperature range of other weather records. So we need to compare the `temp_lo` and `temp_hi` columns of each weather row to the `temp_lo` and `temp_hi` columns of all other weather rows. We can do this with the following query:

```postgresql
SELECT w1.city, w1.temp_lo AS low, w1.temp_hi AS high, 
			w2.city, w2.temp_lo AS low, w2.temp_hi AS high     
	FROM weather w1 JOIN weather w2         
		ON w1.temp_lo < w2.temp_lo AND w1.temp_hi > w2.temp_hi;
```

```
     city      | low | high |     city      | low | high
---------------+-----+------+---------------+-----+------
 San Francisco |  43 |   57 | San Francisco |  46 |   50
 Hayward       |  37 |   54 | San Francisco |  46 |   50
(2 rows)
```

If we wanted to know what city that has the highest low-temperature, we might try:

```postgresql
SELECT city FROM weather WHERE temp_lo = max(temp_lo);     WRONG
```

but this will not work since the aggregate `max` cannot be used in the `WHERE` clause. (This restriction exists because the `WHERE` clause determines which rows will be included in the aggregate calculation; so obviously it has to be evaluated before aggregate functions are computed.) However, as is often the case the query can be restated to accomplish the desired result, here by using a **subquery**:

```postgresql
SELECT city FROM weather     
	WHERE temp_lo = (SELECT max(temp_lo) FROM weather);
```

```
     city
---------------
 San Francisco
(1 row)
```

Aggregates are also very useful in combination with `GROUP BY` clauses.

```postgresql
SELECT city, count(*), max(temp_lo)     
	FROM weather     
	GROUP BY city;
```

```
     city      | count | max
---------------+-------+-----
 Hayward       |     1 |  37
 San Francisco |     2 |  46
(2 rows)
```

We can filter these grouped rows using `HAVING`:

```postgresql
SELECT city, count(*), max(temp_lo)     
	FROM weather     
	GROUP BY city    
  HAVING max(temp_lo) < 40;
```

```
  city   | count | max
---------+-------+-----
 Hayward |     1 |  37
(1 row)
```

Finally, if we only care about cities whose names begin with “S”, we might do:

```postgresql
SELECT city, count(*), max(temp_lo)     
	FROM weather     
	WHERE city LIKE 'S%'            
	GROUP BY city;
```

```
     city      | count | max
---------------+-------+-----
 San Francisco |     2 |  46
(1 row)
```

The fundamental difference between `WHERE` and `HAVING` is this: `WHERE` selects input rows before groups and aggregates are computed (thus, it controls which rows go into the aggregate computation), whereas `HAVING` selects group rows after groups and aggregates are computed. Thus, the `WHERE` clause must not contain aggregate functions; it makes no sense to try to use an aggregate to determine which rows will be inputs to the aggregates. On the other hand, the `HAVING` clause always contains aggregate functions. (Strictly speaking, you are allowed to write a `HAVING` clause that doesn't use aggregates, but it's seldom useful. The same condition could be used more efficiently at the `WHERE` stage.)

Another way to select the rows that go into an aggregate computation is to use `FILTER`, which is a **per-aggregate** option:

```postgresql
SELECT city, count(*) FILTER (WHERE temp_lo < 45), max(temp_lo)     
	FROM weather     
	GROUP BY city;
```

```
     city      | count | max
---------------+-------+-----
 Hayward       |     1 |  37
 San Francisco |     1 |  46
(2 rows)
```

`FILTER` is much like `WHERE`, except that it removes rows only from the input of the particular aggregate function that it is attached to. Here, the count aggregate counts only rows with `temp_lo` below 45; but the max aggregate is still applied to all rows, so it still finds the reading of 46.

You can update existing rows using the `UPDATE` command.

```postgresql
UPDATE weather     
	SET temp_hi = temp_hi - 2,  temp_lo = temp_lo - 2     
	WHERE date > '1994-11-28';
```

Rows can be removed from a table using the `DELETE` command.

```postgresql
DELETE FROM weather WHERE city = 'Hayward';
```

```postgresql
DELETE FROM tablename;
```

Without a qualification, `DELETE` will remove all rows from the given table, leaving it empty. The system will not request confirmation before doing this!
