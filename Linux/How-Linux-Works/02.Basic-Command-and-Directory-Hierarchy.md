## Basic Command and Directory Hierarchy

### Basic Commands

#### `ls`

#### `cp`

To copy file1 to file2:

```sh
$ cp file1 file2
```

You can also copy a file to another directory, keeping the same file name in that directory:

```sh
$ cp file dir
```

To copy more than one file to a directory (folder) named dir, try something like this example, which copies three files:

```sh
$ cp file1 file2 file3 dir	
```

#### `mv`

The mv (move) command works much like cp. In its simplest form, it renames a file. For example, to rename file1 to file2, enter this:

```sh
$ mv file1 file2
```

You can also use mv to move files to other directories in the same way as cp.

#### `touch`

The touch command can create a file. If the target file already exists, touch doesn’t change the file, but it does update the file’s modification timestamp.

```
$ touch file

$ ls -l file
```

#### `rm`

#### `echo`

The echo command prints its arguments to the standard output.

### Navigating Directories

#### `cd`

#### `mkdir`

#### `rmdir`

#### Shell Globbing (“Wildcards”)

The shell can match simple patterns to file and directory names, a process known as globbing. This is similar to the concept of wildcards in other systems.  The simplest of these is the glob character `*`, which tells the shell to match any number of arbitrary characters. For example, the following command prints a list of files in the current directory:

```
$ echo *
```

Here are some ways to use * to expand filenames: 

- `at*` expands to all filenames that start with at.
- `*at` expands to all filenames that end with at.
- `*at*` expands to all filenames that contain at.

Another shell glob character, the question mark (`?`), instructs the shell to match exactly one arbitrary character. For example, `b?at` matches `boat` and `brat`.

If you don’t want the shell to expand a glob in a command, enclose the glob in single quotes (`''`). For example, the command `echo '*'` prints a star.

### Intermediate Commands

#### `grep`

The `grep` command prints the lines from a file or input stream that match an expression. For example, to print the lines in the `/etc/passwd` file that contain the text `root`, enter this:

```
$ grep root /etc/passwd
```

For example, if you want to check every file in `/etc` that contains the word `root`, you could use this command:

```
$ grep root /etc/*
```

Two of the most important grep options are `-i` (for case-insensitive matches) and `-v` (which inverts the search—that is, prints all lines that don’t match). There is also a more powerful variant called `egrep` (which is just a synonym for `grep -E`).

`grep` understands regular expressions. There are three important things to remember about regular expressions: 

- `.*` matches any number of characters, including none (like the `*` in globs and wildcards).
- `.+` matches any one or more characters.
- `.` matches exactly one arbitrary character.

#### `less`

The `less` command comes in handy when a file is really big or when a command’s output is long and scrolls off the top of the screen.

To page through a big file like `/usr/share/dict/words`, you can use the command `less /usr/share/dict/words`. When running `less`, you’ll see the contents of the file one screenful at a time. Press the **spacebar** to go forward in the file and press **b** (lowercase) to skip back one screenful. To quit, press **q**.

**Note**: The `less` command is an enhanced version of an older program named `more`. If you ever run into a situation when you can’t use `less`, try `more`.

You can also search for text inside `less`. For example, to search forward for a `word`, you can type `/word`, and to search backward, you can use `?word`.  When you find a match, press **n** to continue searching.

You can send the standard output of nearly any program directly to another program’s standard input. This is exceptionally useful when you have a command with a lot of output to sift through and you’d like to use something like `less` to view the output. Here’s an example of sending the output of a `grep` command to `less`:

```
$ grep ie /usr/share/dict/words | less
```

#### `pwd`

#### `diff`

To see the differences between two text files, use `diff`:

```
$ diff file1 file2
```

Several options can control the format of the output, and the default output format is often the most comprehensible for human beings. However, most programmers prefer the output from `diff -u` when they need to send the output to someone else, because automated tools have an easier time with this format.

#### `file`

If you see a file and are unsure of its format, try using the `file` command to see if the system can guess it:

```
$ file file
```

#### `find` and `locate`

It’s frustrating when you know that a certain file is in a directory tree somewhere but you just don’t know where. Run `find` to find `file` in `dir` as follows:

```
$ find dir -name file -print
```

Most systems also have a `locate` command for finding files. Rather than searching for a file in real time, `locate` searches an index that the system builds periodically. Searching with `locate` is much faster than `find`, but if the file you’re looking for is newer than the index, `locate` won’t find it.

#### `head` and `tail`

The `head` and `tail` commands allow you to quickly view a portion of a file or stream of data. For example, `head /etc/passwd` shows the first 10 lines of the password file, and `tail /etc/passwd` shows the last 10 lines.

To change the number of lines to display, use the `-n` option, where n is the number of lines you want to see (for example, `head -5 /etc/passwd`).

#### `sort`

The `sort` command quickly puts the lines of a text file in alphanumeric order. If the file’s lines start with numbers and you want to sort in numerical order, use the `-n` option. The `-r` option reverses the order of the sort.

### Changing Your Password and Shell

Use the `passwd` command to change your password.

You can change your shell with the `chsh` command (to an alternative such as `zsh`, `ksh` or `tcsh`)

### Environment and Shell Variables

The shell can store temporary variables, called shell variables, containing the values of text strings.

To assign a value to a shell variable, use the equal sign (=). Here’s a simple example:

```
$ STUFF=blah
```

The preceding example sets the value of the variable named `STUFF` to `blah`. To access this variable, use `$STUFF` (for example, try running `echo $STUFF`).

**Note**: Don’t put any spaces around the `=` when assigning a variable.

An environment variable is like a shell variable, but it’s not specific to the shell. All processes on Unix systems have environment variable storage. The main difference between environment and shell variables is that the operating system passes all of your shell’s environment variables to programs that the shell runs, whereas shell variables cannot be accessed in the commands that you run.

You assign an environment variable with the shell’s `export` command. For example, if you’d like to make the `$STUFF` shell variable into an environment variable, use the following:

```
$ STUFF=blah 
$ export STUFF
```

Because child processes inherit environment variables from their parent, many programs read them for configuration and options. For example, you can put your favorite `less` command-line options in the `LESS` environment variable, and less will use those options when you run it.

### The Command Path

`PATH` is a special environment variable that contains the command path (or path for short), a list of system directories that the shell searches when trying to locate a command. For example, when you run `ls`, the shell searches the directories listed in `PATH` for the `ls` program. If programs with the same name appear in several directories in the path, the shell runs the first matching program.

If you run echo `$PATH`, you’ll see that the path components are separated by colons (`:`).

To tell the shell to look in more places for programs, change the `PATH` environment variable. For example, by using this command, you can add a directory `dir` to the beginning of the path so that the shell looks in `dir` before looking in any of the other `PATH` directories:

```
$ PATH=dir:$PATH
```

Or you can append a directory name to the end of the `PATH` variable, causing the shell to look in `dir` last:

```
$ PATH=$PATH:dir
```

### Command-Line Editing

### Getting Online Help

To search for a manual page by keyword, use the `-k` option:

```
$ man -k keyword
```

This is helpful if you don’t quite know the name of the command that you want. For example, if you’re looking for a command to sort something, run:

```
$ man -k sort
```

![image-20241128223228335](./images/image-20241128223228335.png)

For example, to read the `/etc/passwd` file description (as opposed to the `passwd` command), you can insert the section number before the page name like so:

```
$ man 5 passwd
```

If you’re just looking for a certain option for a command, try entering a command name followed by `--help` or `-h`

### Shell Input and Output

To send the output of command to a file instead of the terminal, use the `>` redirection character:

```
$ command > file
```

The shell creates `file` if it does not already exist. If `file` exists, the shell erases (clobbers) the original file first. (Some shells have parameters that prevent clobbering. For example, you can enter `set -C` to avoid clobbering in `bash`.) 

You can append the output to the file instead of overwriting it with the `>>` redirection syntax:

```
$ command >> file
```

To send the standard output of a command to the standard input of another command, use the pipe character (`|`). To see how this works, try these two commands:

```
$ head /proc/cpuinfo 
$ head /proc/cpuinfo | tr a-z A-Z
```

#### Standard Error

You can redirect the standard error if you like. For example, to send standard output to `f` and standard error to `e`, use the `2>` syntax, like this:

```
$ ls /fffffffff > f 2> e
```

The number 2 specifies the stream ID that the shell modifies. Stream ID 1 is standard output (the default), and 2 is standard error.

You can also send the standard error to the same place as stdout with the `>&` notation. For example, to send both standard output and standard error to the file named `f`, try this command:

```
$ ls /fffffffff > f 2>&1
```

#### Standard Input Redirection

To channel a file to a program’s standard input, use the `<` operator:

```
$ head < /proc/cpuinfo
```

You will occasionally run into a program that requires this type of redirection, but because most Unix commands accept filenames as arguments, this isn’t very common. For example, the preceding command could have been written as `head /proc/cpuinfo`.

### Listing and Manipulating Processes

For a quick listing of running processes, just run `ps` on the command line.

- `STAT` The process status—that is, what the process is doing and where its memory resides. For example, S means sleeping and R means running. (See the ps(1) manual page for a description of all the symbols.) 

- `TIME` The amount of CPU time in minutes and seconds that the process has used so far.

#### `ps` Command Options

Here are some of the most useful option combinations: 

- `ps x` Show all of your running processes.
- `ps ax` Show all processes on the system, not just the ones you own.
- `ps u` Include more detailed information on processes.
- `ps w` Show full command names, not just what fits on one line.

To check on a specific process, add its PID to the argument list of the `ps` command. For example, to inspect the current shell process, you can use `ps u $$` (`$$` is a shell variable that evaluates to the current shell’s PID).

#### Process Termination

To terminate a process, you send it a signal—a message to a process from the kernel—with the `kill` command. In most cases, all you need to do is this:

```
$ kill pid
```

There are many types of signals. The default (used above) is `TERM`, or terminate. You can send different signals by adding an extra option to `kill`. For example, to freeze a process instead of terminating it, use the `STOP` signal:

```
$ kill -STOP pid
```

A stopped process is still in memory, ready to pick up where it left off. Use the `CONT` signal to continue running the process again:

```
$ kill -CONT pid
```

**Note**: Using `CTRL-C` to terminate a process that is running in the current terminal is the same as using `kill` to end the process with the `INT` (interrupt) signal.

You may see other users entering numbers instead of names with `kill`—for example, `kill -9` instead of `kill -KILL`. This is because the kernel uses numbers to denote the different signals; you can use `kill` this way if you know the number of the signal that you want to send. Run `kill -l` to get a mapping of signal numbers to names.

#### Job Control

Shells support job control, a way to send `TSTP` (similar to `STOP`) and `CONT` signals to programs by using various keystrokes and commands. This allows you to suspend and switch between programs you’re using. For example, you can send a `TSTP` signal with `CTRL-Z` and then start the process again by entering `fg` (bring to foreground) or `bg` (move to background).

**Note**: To see if you’ve accidentally suspended any processes on your current terminal, run the `jobs` command.

#### Background Processes

Normally, when you run a Unix command from the shell, you don’t get the shell prompt back until the program finishes executing. However, you can detach a process from the shell and put it in the “background” with the ampersand (`&`); this gives you the prompt back. For example, if you have a large file that you need to decompress with `gunzip`, and you want to do some other stuff while it’s running, run a command like this one:

```
$ gunzip file.gz &
```

The shell should respond by printing the PID of the new background process, and the prompt should return immediately so that you can continue working. If the process takes a very long time, it can even continue to run after you log out, which comes in particularly handy if you have to run a program that does a lot of number crunching. If the process finishes before you log out or close the terminal window, the shell usually notifies you, depending on your setup.

**Note**: If you’re remotely accessing a machine and want to keep a program running when you log out, you may need to use the `nohup` command; see its manual page for details.

The dark side of running background processes is that they may expect to work with the standard input (or worse, read directly from the terminal). If a program tries to read something from the standard input when it’s in the background, it can freeze (try `fg` to bring it back) or terminate. Also, if the program writes to the standard output or standard error, the output can appear in the terminal window with no regard for anything else running there, meaning that you can get unexpected output when you’re working on something else.

The best way to make sure that a background process doesn’t bother you is to redirect its output (and possibly input) as described in Section 2.14.

### File Modes and Permissions

Some executable files have an `s` in the user permissions listing instead of an `x`. This indicates that the executable is **setuid**, meaning that when you execute the program, it runs as though the file owner is the user instead of you. Many programs use this setuid bit to run as root in order to get the privileges they need to change system files. One example is the `passwd` program, which needs to change the `/etc/passwd` file.

#### Modifying Permissions

For example, to add group (`g`) and world (`o`, for “other”) read (`r`) permissions to file, you could run these two commands:

```
$ chmod g+r file 
$ chmod o+r file
```

Or you could do it all in one shot:

```
$ chmod go+r file
```

To remove these permissions, use `go-r` instead of `go+r`.

You may sometimes see people changing permissions with numbers, for example:

```
$ chmod 644 file
```

This is called an **absolute** change because it sets all permission bits at once.

Directories also have permissions. You can list the contents of a directory if it’s readable, but you can only access a file in a directory if the directory is executable. You need both in most cases; one common mistake people make when setting the permissions of directories is to accidentally remove the execute permission when using absolute modes.

Finally, you can specify a set of default permissions with the `umask` shell command, which applies a predefined set of permissions to any new file you create. In general, use `umask 022` if you want everyone to be able to see all of the files and directories that you create, and use `umask 077` if you don’t. If you want to make your desired permissions mask apply to new windows and later sessions, you need to put the `umask` command with the desired mode in one of your startup files, as discussed in Chapter 13.

#### Working with Symbolic Links

A symbolic link is a file that points to another file or a directory, effectively creating an alias (like a shortcut in Windows). Symbolic links offer quick access to obscure directory paths.

In a long directory listing, symbolic links look like this (notice the `l` as the file type in the file mode):

```
lrwxrwxrwx 1 ruser users  11 Feb 27 13:52  somedir -> /home/origdir
```

If you try to access `somedir` in this directory, the system gives you `/home/origdir` instead. Symbolic links are simply filenames that point to other names. Their names and the paths to which they point don’t have to mean anything. In the preceding example, `/home/origdir` doesn’t need to exist.

To create a symbolic link from target to linkname, use `ln -s` as follows:

```
$ ln -s target linkname
```

**Warning**: Don’t forget the `-s` option when creating a symbolic link. Without it, `ln` creates a hard link, giving an additional real filename to a single file. The new filename has the status of the old one; it points (links) directly to the file data instead of to another filename as a symbolic link does. Hard links can be even more confusing than symbolic links. Unless you understand the material in Section 4.6, avoid using them.

### Archiving and Compressing Files

Now that you’ve learned about files, permissions, and possible errors, you need to master `gzip` and `tar`, two common utilities for compressing and bundling files and directories.

#### `gzip`

The program `gzip` (GNU Zip) is one of the current standard Unix compression programs. A file that ends with `.gz` is a GNU Zip archive. Use gunzip `file.gz` to uncompress `<file>.gz` and remove the suffix; to compress the file again, use `gzip file`.

#### `tar`

Unlike the ZIP programs for other operating systems, `gzip` does not create archives of files; that is, it doesn’t pack multiple files and directories into a single file. To create an archive, use `tar` instead:

```
$ tar cvf archive.tar file1 file2 ...
```

Archives created by `tar` usually have a `.tar` suffix (this is by convention; it isn’t required). For example, in the previous command, `file1`, `file2`, and so on are the names of the files and directories that you wish to archive in `<archive>.tar`. The `c` flag activates create mode. The `v` and `f` flags have more specific roles.

The `v` flag activates verbose diagnostic output, causing `tar` to print the names of the files and directories in the archive when it encounters them. Adding another `v` causes tar to print details such as file size and permissions. If you don’t want tar to tell you what it’s doing, omit the `v` flag.

The `f` flag denotes the file option. The next argument on the command line after the `f` flag must be the archive file for `tar` to create (in the preceding example, it is `<archive>.tar`). You must use this option followed by a filename at all times, except with tape drives. To use standard input or output, set the filename to a dash (`-`).

##### Unpacking `.tar` Files

To unpack a `.tar` file with tar use the `x` flag:

```
$ tar xvf archive.tar
```

In this command, the `x` flag puts tar into **extract (unpack) mode**. You can extract individual parts of the archive by entering the names of the parts at the end of the command line, but you must know their exact names. (To find out for sure, see the table-of-contents mode described next.)

##### Using Table-of-Contents Mode

Before unpacking, it’s usually a good idea to check the contents of a `.tar` file with the **table-of-contents mode** by using the `t` flag instead of the `x` flag. This mode verifies the archive’s basic integrity and prints the names of all files inside. If you don’t test an archive before unpacking it, you can end up dumping a huge mess of files into the current directory, which can be really difficult to clean up.

When you check an archive with the `t` mode, verify that everything is in a rational directory structure; that is, all file pathnames in the archive should start with the same directory. If you’re unsure, create a temporary directory, change to it, and then extract.

When unpacking, consider using the `p` option to preserve permissions. Use this in extract mode to override your `umask` and get the exact permissions specified in the archive.

#### Compressed Archives (`.tar.gz`)

To unpack a compressed archive, work from the right side to the left; get rid of the `.gz` first and then worry about the `.tar`. For example, these two commands decompress and unpack `<file>.tar.gz`:

```
$ gunzip file.tar.gz 
$ tar xvf file.tar
```

To create a compressed archive, do the reverse: run `tar` first and `gzip` second.

#### `zcat`

The method just shown isn’t the fastest or most efficient way to invoke tar on a compressed archive, and it wastes disk space and kernel I/O time. A better way is to combine archival and compression functions with a pipeline. For example, this command pipeline unpacks `<file>.tar.gz`:

```
$ zcat file.tar.gz | tar xvf -
```

The `zcat` command is the same as `gunzip -dc`. The `-d` option decompresses and the `-c` option sends the result to standard output (in this case, to the `tar` command).

Because it’s so common to use `zcat`, the version of tar that comes with Linux has a shortcut. You can use `z` as an option to automatically invoke `gzip` on the archive; this works both for extracting an archive (with the `x` or `t` modes in `tar`) and creating one (with `c`). For example, use the following to verify a compressed archive:

```
$ tar ztvf file.tar.gz
```
